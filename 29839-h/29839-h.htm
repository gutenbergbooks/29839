<h3>CHAPTER I<br />The Sound in the Night</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/U.png" title="" alt="U" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">UPON</span> the moonlit stillness came suddenly
a far-off, muffled, crashing sound. Just
once it came, then once again the stillness
of the wilderness night, the stillness of vast, untraversed
solitude. The Boy lifted his eyes and glanced
across the thin reek of the camp-fire at Jabe Smith,
who sat smoking contemplatively. Answering the
glance, the woodsman muttered &ldquo;old tree fallin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
and resumed his passive contemplation of the sticks
glowing keenly in the fire. The Boy, upon whom,
as soon as he entered the wilderness, the taciturnity
of the woodsfolk descended as a garment, said
nothing, but scanned his companion&rsquo;s gaunt face
with a gravely incredulous smile.</p>
</div>
<p>So wide-spread and supreme was the silence that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
five seconds after that single strange sound had
died out it seemed, somehow, impossible to believe
it had ever been. The light gurgle of the shallow
and shrunken brook which ran past the open front
of the travellers&rsquo; &ldquo;lean-to&rdquo; served only to measure
the stillness. Both Jabe and the Boy, since
eating their dinner, had gradually forgotten to talk.
As the moon rose over the low, fir-crested hills they
had sunk into reverie, watching the camp-fire die
down.</p>
<p>At last, with a sort of crisp whisper a stick, burnt
through the middle, fell apart, and a flicker of red
flame leaped up. The woodsman knocked out his
pipe, rose slowly to his feet, stretched his gaunt
length, and murmured, &ldquo;Reckon we might as well
turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right for you, Jabe,&rdquo; answered the
Boy, rising also, tightening his belt, and reaching
for his rifle, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going off to see what I can
see. Night&rsquo;s the time to see things in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jabe grunted non-committally, and began spreading
his blanket in the lean-to. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forgit to
come back for breakfast, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he muttered.
He regarded the Boy as a phenomenally brilliant
hunter and trapper spoiled by sentimental notions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></div>
<p>To the Boy, whose interest in all pertaining to
woodcraft was much broader and more sympathetic
than that of his companion, Jabe&rsquo;s interpretation of
the sound of the falling tree had seemed hasty and
shallow. He knew that there was no better all-round
woodsman in these countries than Jabe
Smith; but he knew also that Jabe&rsquo;s interest in the
craft was limited pretty strictly to his activities as
hunter, trapper and lumberman. Just now he was
all lumberman. He was acting as what is called
a &ldquo;timber-cruiser,&rdquo; roaming the remoter and less-known
regions of the wilderness to locate the best
growths of spruce and pine for the winter&rsquo;s lumbering
operations, and for the present his keen faculties
were set on the noting of tree growths, and
water-courses, and the lay of the land for the getting
out of a winter&rsquo;s cutting. On this particular
cruise the Boy&ndash;&ndash;who, for all the disparity in their
years and the divergence in their views, was his
most valued comrade&ndash;&ndash;had accompanied him with
a special object in view. The region they were
cruising was one which had never been adequately
explored, and it was said to be full of little unnamed,
unmapped lakes and streams, where, in
former days, the Indians had had great beaver
hunting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>When the sound of the falling tree came to his
ears across the night-silence, the Boy at once said
to himself, &ldquo;Beavers, at work!&rdquo; He said it to
himself, not aloud, because he knew that Jabe also,
as a trapper, would be interested in beavers; and
he had it in his mind to score a point on Jabe.
Noiseless as a lynx in his soft-soled &ldquo;larrigans,&rdquo;
he ascended the half-empty channel of the brook,
which here strained its shrunken current through
rocks and slate-slabs, between steep banks. The
channel curved steadily, rounding the shoulder of
a low ridge. When he felt that he had travelled
somewhat less than half a mile, he came out upon a
bit of swampy marsh, beyond which, over the crest
of a low dam, spread the waters of a tranquil pond
shining like a mirror in the moonlight.</p>
<p>The Boy stopped short, his heart thumping with
excitement and anticipation. Here before him was
what he had come so far to find. From his books
and from his innumerable talks with hunter and
trapper, he knew that the dam and the shining,
lonely pond were the work of beavers. Presently
he distinguished amid the sheen of the water a
tiny, grassy islet, with a low, dome-shaped, stick-covered
mound at one end of it. This, plainly, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
a beaver house, the first he had ever seen. His
delighted eyes, observing it at this distance, at once
pronounced it immeasurably superior to the finest
and most pretentious muskrat-house he had ever
seen&ndash;&ndash;a very palace, indeed, by comparison.
Then, a little further up the pond, and apparently
adjoining the shore, he made out another dome-shaped
structure, broader and less conspicuous than
the first, and more like a mere pile of sticks. The
pond, which was several acres in extent, seemed
to him an extremely spacious domain for the dwellers
in these two houses.</p>
<p>Presently he marked a black trail, as it were,
moving down in the middle of the radiance from
the upper end of the pond. It was obviously the
trail of some swimmer, but much too broad, it
seemed, to be made by anything so small as a
beaver. It puzzled him greatly. In his eagerness
he pushed noiselessly forward, seeking a better
view, till he was within some thirty feet of the dam.
Then he made out a small dark spot in the front
of the trail,&ndash;&ndash;evidently a beaver&rsquo;s head; and at
last he detected that the little swimmer was carrying
a bushy branch, one end held in his mouth while
the rest was slung back diagonally across his shoulders.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>The Boy crept forward like a cat, his gray eyes
shining with expectancy. His purpose was to gain
a point where he could crouch in ambush behind
the dam, and perhaps get a view of the lake-dwellers
actually at work. He was within six or eight
feet of the dam, crouching low (for the dam was
not more than three feet in height), when his
trained and cunning ear caught a soft swirling
sound in the water on the other side of the barrier.
Instantly he stiffened to a statue, just as he was,
his mouth open so that not a pant of his quickened
breath might be audible. The next moment the head
of a beaver appeared over the edge of the dam, not
ten feet away, and stared him straight in the face.</p>
<p>The beaver had a stick of alder in its mouth, to
be used, no doubt, in some repairing of the dam.
The Boy, all in gray as he was, and absolutely
motionless, trusted to be mistaken for one of the
gnarled, gray stumps with which the open space
below the dam was studded. He had read that the
beaver was very near-sighted, and on that he based
his hopes, though he was so near, and the moonlight
so clear, that he could see the bright eyes of
the newcomer staring straight into his with insistent
question. Evidently, the story of that near-sightedness
had not been exaggerated. He saw the
doubt in the beaver&rsquo;s eye fade gradually into confidence,
as the little animal became convinced that
the strange gray figure was in reality just one of
the stumps. Then, the industrious dam-builder
began to climb out upon the crest of the dam, dragging
his huge and hairless tail, and glancing along
as if to determine where the stick which he carried
would do most good. At this critical moment,
when the eager watcher felt that he was just about
to learn the exact methods of these wonderful architects
of the wild, a stick in the slowly settling mud
beneath his feet broke with a soft, thick-muffled
snap.</p>

&ldquo;BEGAN TO CLIMB OUT UPON THE CREST OF THE DAM.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>So soft was the sound that it barely reached the
Boy&rsquo;s ears. To the marvellously sensitive ears of
the beaver, however, it was a warning more than
sufficient. It was a noisy proclamation of peril.
Swift as a wink of light, the beaver dropped his
stick and dived head first into the pond. The Boy
straightened up just in time to see him vanish. As
he vanished, his broad, flat, naked tail hit the water
with a cracking slap which resounded over the pond
like a pistol-shot. It was re&euml;choed by four or five
more splashes from the upper portion of the pond.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Then all was silence again, and the Boy realized that
there would be no more chance that night for him
to watch the little people of the House in the Water.
Mounting the firm-woven face of the dam and
casting his eyes all over the pond, he satisfied himself
that two houses which he had first seen were
all that it contained. Then, resisting the impulse
of his excitement, which was to explore all around
the pond&rsquo;s borders at once, he resolutely turned his
face back to camp, full of thrilling plans for the
morrow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />The Battle in the Pond</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/A.png" title="" alt="A" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">AT</span> breakfast, in the crisp of the morning,
while yet the faint mists clung over the
brook and the warmth of the camp-fire
was attractive, the Boy proclaimed his find. Jabe
had asked no questions, inquisitiveness being contrary
to the backwoodsman&rsquo;s code of etiquette; but
his silence had been full of interrogation. With
his mouth half-full of fried trout and cornbread,
the Boy remarked:</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was no windfall, Jabe, that noise we
heard last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; muttered the woodsman, rather indifferently.</p>
<p>Without a greater show of interest than that the
Boy would not divulge his secret. He helped himself
to another flaky pink section of trout, and became
seemingly engrossed in it. Presently the
woodsman spoke again. He had been thinking, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
had realized that his prestige had suffered some
kind of blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; drawled the woodsman sarcastically,
&ldquo;it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no windfall. I jest said that to git
quit of bein&rsquo; asked questions when I was sleepy. I
knowed all the time it was beaver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jabe,&rdquo; admitted the Boy, &ldquo;it was beavers.
I&rsquo;ve found a big beaver-pond just up the brook a
ways&ndash;&ndash;a pond with two big beaver-houses in it.
I&rsquo;ve found it&ndash;&ndash;so I claim it as mine, and there
ain&rsquo;t to be any trapping on that pond. Those are
my beavers, Jabe, every one of them, and they
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be shot or trapped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how fur yer injunction&rsquo;d hold in
law,&rdquo; said Jabe dryly, as he speared a thick slab
of bacon from the frying-pan to his tin plate. &ldquo;But
fur as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;ll hold. An&rsquo; I reckon the
boys of the camp this winter&rsquo;ll respect it, too, when
I tell &rsquo;em as how it&rsquo;s your own partic&rsquo;lar beaver
pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your old heart, Jabe!&rdquo; said the Boy.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was hoping. And I imagine
anyway there&rsquo;s lots more beaver round this region
to be food for the jaws of your beastly old traps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Jabe, rising to clear up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
&ldquo;I struck three likely ponds yesterday, as I was
cruisin over to west&rsquo;ard of the camp. I reckon
we kin spare you the sixteen or twenty beaver in
&lsquo;Boy&rsquo;s Pond!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy grinned appreciation of the notable
honour done him in the naming of the pond, and
a little flush of pleasure deepened the red of his
cheeks. He knew that the name would stick, and
eventually go upon the maps, the lumbermen being
a people tenacious of tradition and not to be
swerved from their own way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jabe!&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;But how
do you know there are sixteen or twenty beaver in
my pond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said there was two houses,&rdquo; answered the
woodsman. &ldquo;Well, we reckon always from eight
to ten beaver to each house, bein&rsquo; the old couple,
and then three or four yearlin&rsquo;s not yet kicked out
to set up housekeeping fer themselves, and three
or four youngsters of the spring&rsquo;s whelping. Beavers&rsquo;
good parents, an&rsquo; the family holds together
long&rsquo;s the youngsters needs it. Now I&rsquo;m off. See
you here at noon, fer grub!&rdquo; and picking up his
axe he strode off to southwestward of the camp to
investigate a valley which he had located the day
before.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Left alone, the Boy hurriedly set the camp in
order, rolled up the blankets, washed the dishes,
and put out the last of the fire. Then, picking up
his little Winchester, which he always carried,&ndash;&ndash;though
he never used it on anything more sensitive
than a bottle or a tin can,&ndash;&ndash;he retraced his
steps of the night before, up-stream to the beaver
pond.</p>
<p>Knowing that the beavers do most of their work,
or, at least, most of their above-water work, at
night, he had little hope of catching any of them
abroad by daylight. He approached the dam, nevertheless,
with that noiseless caution which had
become a habit with him in the woods, a habit which
rendered the woods populous for him and teeming
with interest, while to more noisy travellers they
seemed quite empty of life. One thing his study
of the wilderness had well taught him, which was
that the wild kindreds do not by any means always
do just what is expected of them, but rather seem
to delight in contradicting the naturalists.</p>
<p>When he reached the edge of the open, however,
and peered out across the dam, there was absolutely
nothing to break the shining morning stillness. In
the clear sunlight the dam, and the two beaver-houses
beyond, looked larger and more impressive
than they had looked the night before. There was
no sign of life anywhere about the pond, except
a foraging fish-hawk winging above it, with fierce
head stretched low in the search for some basking
trout or chub.</p>

&ldquo;A FORAGING FISH-HAWK WINGING ABOVE.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>Following the usual custom of the wild kindreds
themselves, the Boy stood motionless for some minutes
behind his thin screen of bushes before revealing
himself frankly in the open. His patient watch
being unrewarded, he was on the very verge of
stepping forth, when from the tail of his eye he
caught a motion in the shallow bed of the brook,
and ducked himself. He was too wary to turn his
head; but a moment later a little brown sinuous
shape came into his field of view. It was an otter,
making his way up-stream.</p>
<p>The otter moved with unusual caution, glancing
this way and that and seeming to take minute note
of all he saw. At the foot of the dam he stopped,
and investigated the structure with the air of one
who had never seen it before. So marked was this
air that the Boy concluded he was a stranger to
that region,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a wanderer from the head
of the Ottanoonsis, some fifteen miles southward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
driven away by the operations of a crew of lumbermen
who were building a big lumber-camp there.
However that might be, it was evident that the
brown traveller was a newcomer, an outsider. He
had none of the confident, businesslike manner
which a wild animal wears in moving about his
own range.</p>
<p>When he had stolen softly along the whole base
of the dam, and back again, nosing each little rivulet
of overflow, the otter seemed satisfied that this
was much like all other beaver dams. Then he
mounted to the crest and took a prolonged survey
of the stretch of water beyond. Nothing unusual
appearing, he dived cleanly into the pond, about
the point where, as the Boy guessed, there would
be the greatest depth of water against the dam.
He was apparently heading straight up for the
inlet of the pond, on a path which would take him
within about twenty-five or thirty yards of the main
beaver-house on the island. As soon as he had
vanished under the water the Boy ran forward,
mounted the crest of the dam, and peered with
shaded eyes to see if he could mark the swimmer&rsquo;s
progress.</p>

<p class='caption'>
&ldquo;THE OTTER MOVED WITH UNUSUAL CAUTION.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>For a couple of minutes, perhaps, the surface of
the pond gave no indication of the otter&rsquo;s whereabouts.
Then, just opposite the main beaver-house,
there was a commotion in the water, the surface
curled and eddied, and the otter appeared in great
excitement. He dived again immediately; and
just as he did so the head of a huge beaver poked
up and snatched a breath. Where the two had gone
under, the surface of the pond now fairly boiled;
and the Boy, in his excitement over this novel and
mysterious contest, nearly lost his balance on the
frail crest of the dam. A few moments more and
both adversaries again came to the surface, now at
close grips and fighting furiously. They were followed
almost at once by a second beaver, smaller
than the first, who fell upon the otter with insane
fury. It was plain that the beavers were the aggressors.
The Boy&rsquo;s sympathies were all with the otter,
who from time to time tried vainly to escape from
the battle; and once he raised his rifle. But he bethought
him that the otter, after all, whatever his
intentions, was a trespasser; and that the beavers
had surely a right to police their own pond. He
remembered an old Indian&rsquo;s having told him that
there was always a blood feud between the beaver
and the otter; and how was he to know how just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the cause of offence, or the stake at issue? Lowering
his gun he stared in breathless eagerness.</p>
<p>The otter, however, as it proved, was well able
to take care of himself. Suddenly rearing his sleek,
snaky body half out of the water, he flashed down
upon the smaller beaver and caught it firmly behind
the ear with his long, deadly teeth&ndash;&ndash;teeth designed
to hold the convulsive and slippery writhings of the
largest salmon. With mad contortions the beaver
struggled to break that fatal grip. But the otter
held inexorably, shaking its victim as a terrier does
a rat, and paid no heed whatever to the slashing
assaults of the other beaver. The water was lashed
to such a turmoil that the waves spread all over
the pond, washing up to the Boy&rsquo;s feet on the crest
of the dam, and swaying the bronze-green grasses
about the house on the little island. Though, without
a doubt, all the other citizens of the pond were
watching the battle even more intently than himself,
the Boy could not catch sight of so much as
nose or ear. The rest of the spectators kept close
to the covert of grass tuft and lily pad.</p>

&ldquo;SUDDENLY REARING HIS SLEEK, SNAKY BODY HALF OUT OF THE WATER.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>All at once the small beaver stiffened itself out
convulsively on top of the water, turned belly up,
and began to sink. At the same time the otter let
go, tore free of his second and more dangerous
adversary, and swam desperately for the nearest
point of shore. The surviving beaver, evidently
hurt, made no effort to follow up his victory, but
paddled slowly to the house on the island, where
he disappeared. Presently the otter gained the
shore and dragged himself up. His glossy brown
skin was gashed and streaming with blood, but the
Boy gathered that his wounds were not mortal.
He turned, stared fixedly at the beaver-house for
several seconds as if unwilling to give in, then
stole off through the trees to seek some more hospitable
water. As he vanished, repulsed and maltreated,
the Boy realized for the first time how
hostile even the unsophisticated wilderness is to a
stranger. Among the wild kindreds, even as
among men, most things worth having are preempted.</p>
<p>When the Boy&rsquo;s excitement over this strange
fight had calmed down, he set himself with keen
interest to examining the dam. He knew that by
this time every beaver in the pond was aware of
his presence, and would take good care to keep out
of sight; so there was no longer anything to be
gained by concealment. Pacing the crest, he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
it to be about one hundred feet in length. At the
centre, and through a great part of its length, it
was a little over three feet high, its ends diminishing
gradually into the natural rise of the shores.
The base of the dam, as far as he could judge,
seemed to be about twelve feet in thickness, its
upper face constructed with a much more gradual
slope than the lower. The whole structure, which
was built of poles, brush, stones, and earth, appeared
to be very substantial, a most sound and
enduring piece of workmanship. But along the
crest, which was not more than a foot and a half
in width, it was built with a certain looseness and
elasticity for which he was at a loss to account.
Presently he observed, however, that this dam had
no place of overflow for letting off the water. The
water stood in the pond at a height that brought
it within three or four inches of the crest. At this
level he saw that it was escaping, without violence,
by percolating through the toughly but loosely
woven tissue of sticks and twigs. The force of the
overflow was thus spread out so thin that its destructive
effect on the dam was almost nothing. It
went filtering, with little trickling noises, down
over and through the whole lower face of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
structure, there to gather again into a brook and
resume its sparkling journey toward the sea.</p>
<p>The long upper slope of the dam was smoothly
and thoroughly faced with clay, so that none of its
framework showed through, save here and there
the butt of a sapling perhaps three or four inches
in diameter, which proclaimed the solidity of the
foundations. The lower face, on the other hand,
was all an inexplicable interlacing of sticks and
poles which seemed at first glance heaped together
at haphazard. On examination, however, the Boy
found that every piece was woven in so firmly
among its fellows that it took some effort to remove
it. The more he studied the structure, the more his
admiration grew, and his appreciation of the reasoning
intelligence of its builders; and he smiled
to himself a little controversial smile, as he thought
how inadequate what men call instinct would be to
such a piece of work as this.</p>
<p>But what impressed him most, as a mark of engineering
skill and sound calculation on the part of
the pond-people, was the direction in which the dam
was laid. At either end, where the water was shoal,
and comparatively dead even in time of freshet, the
dam ran straight, taking the shortest way. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
where it crossed the main channel of the brook, and
required the greatest strength, it had a pronounced
upward curve to help it resist the thrust of the current.
He contemplated this strong curve for some
time; then, a glance at the sun reminding him that
it was near noon, he took off his cap to the low-domed
house in the water and made haste back to
camp for dinner.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />In the Under-water World</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/M.png" title="" alt="M" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_13'><span class="dcap">MEANWHILE</span>, in the dark chamber and
the long, dim corridors of the House in
the Water there was great perturbation.
The battle with the otter had been a tremendous
episode in their industrious, well-ordered lives, and
they were wildly excited over it. But much more
important to them&ndash;&ndash;to all but the big beaver who
was now nursing his triumphant wounds&ndash;&ndash;was the
presence of Man in their solitude. Man had
hitherto been but a tradition among them, a vague
but alarming tradition. And now his appearance,
yesterday and to-day, filled them with terror. That
vision of the Boy, standing tall and ominous on the
dam, and afterwards going forward and backward
over it, pulling at it, apparently seeking to destroy
it, seemed to portend mysterious disasters. After
he was gone, and well gone, almost every beaver
in the pond, not only from the main house but also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
from the lodge over on the bank, swam down and
made a flurried inspection of the dam, without
showing his head above water, to see if the structure
on which they all depended had been tampered
with. One by one, each on his own responsibility,
they swam down and inspected the water-face; and
one by one they swam back, more or less relieved
in their minds.</p>
</div>
<p>All, of course, except the big beaver who had
been in the fight. If it had not been for that vision
of the Boy, he would have crept out upon the dry
grass of the little island and there licked and comforted
his wounds in the comforting sunlight.
Now, however, he dared not allow himself that
luxury. His strong love of cleanliness made him
reluctant to take his bleeding gashes into the house;
but there was nothing else to be done. He was
the head of the household, however, so there was
none to gainsay him. He dived into the mouth of
the shorter of the two entrances, mounted the
crooked and somewhat steep passage, and curled
himself upon the dry grass in one corner of the
dark, secluded chamber. His hurts were painful,
and ugly, but none of them deadly, and he knew
he would soon be all right again. There was none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
of that foreknowledge of death upon him which
sometimes drives a sick animal to abdicate his rights
and crawl away by himself for the last great contest.</p>
<p>The room wherein the big beaver lay down to
recover himself was not spacious nor particularly
well ventilated, but in every other respect it was
very admirably adapted to the needs of its occupants.
Through the somewhat porous ceiling, a
three-foot thickness of turf and sticks, came a little
air, but no light. This, however, did not matter
to the beavers, whose ears and noses were of more
significance to them than their eyes. In floor area
the chamber was something like five feet by six and
a half, but in height not much more than eighteen
inches. The floor of this snug retreat was not five
inches above the level of the water in the passages
leading in to it; but so excellently was it constructed
as to be altogether free from damp. It was daintily
clean, moreover; and the beds of dry grass around
the edges of the chamber were clean and fresh.</p>
<p>From this room the living, sleeping, and dining
room of the beaver family, ran two passageways
communicating with the outside world. Both of
these were roofed over to a point well outside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
walls of the house, and had their opening in the
bottom of the pond, where the water was considerably
more than three feet in depth. One of these
passages was perfectly straight, about two feet in
width, and built on a long, gradual slope. It was
by this entrance that the house-dwellers were wont
to bring in their food supplies, in the shape of
sticks of green willow, birch and poplar. When
these sticks were stripped clean of their bark, which
was the beavers&rsquo; chief nourishment, they were then
dragged out again, and floated down to be used in
the repair of the dam. The other passage, especially
adapted to quick exit in case of danger from
the way of the roof, was about as spacious as the
first, but much shorter and steeper. It was crooked,
moreover,&ndash;&ndash;for a reason doubtless adequate to the
architects, but obscure to mere human observers.
The exits of both passages were always in open
water, no matter how fierce the frosts of the winter,
how thick the armour of ice over the surface of
the pond. In the neighbourhood of the house were
springs bubbling up through the bottom, and keeping
the temperature of the pond fairly uniform
throughout the coldest weather, so that the ice, at
worst, never attained a thickness of more than a
foot and a half, even though in the bigger lakes
of that region it might make to a depth of three
feet and over.</p>

&ldquo;POKED HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.&rdquo;<br />

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>While the wounded beaver lay in the chamber
licking his honourable gashes, two other members
of the family entered and approached him. In
some simple but adequate speech it was conveyed
to them that their presence was not required, and
they retreated precipitately, taking different exits.
One swam to the grassy edge of the islet, poked
his head above water under the covert of some
drooping weeds, listened motionless for some minutes,
then wormed himself out among the long
grasses and lay basking, hidden from all the world
but the whirling hawk overhead. The other, of a
more industrious mould, swam off toward the upper
end of the pond where, as he knew, there was work
to be done.</p>
<p>Still as was the surface of the pond, below the
surface there was life and movement. Every little
while the surface would be softly broken, and a
tiny ripple would set out in widening circles toward
the shore, starting from a small dark nose thrust
up for a second. The casual observer would have
said that these were fish rising for flies; but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
fact it was the apprehensive beavers coming up to
breathe, afraid to show themselves on account of
the Boy. They were all sure that he had not really
gone, but was in hiding somewhere, waiting to
pounce upon them.</p>
<p>It was the inhabitants of the House in the Water
who were moving about the pond, this retreat being
occupied by their wounded and ill-humoured champion.
The inhabitants of the other house, over on
the shore, who had been interested but remote spectators
through all the strange events of the morning,
were now in comfortable seclusion, resting till
it should be counted a safe time to go about their
affairs. Some were sleeping, or gnawing on sappy
willow sticks, in the spacious chamber of their
house, while others were in the deeper and more
secret retreats of their two burrows high up in the
bank, connecting with the main house by roomy
tunnels partly filled with water. The two families
were quite independent of each other, except for
their common interest in keeping the great dam in
repair. In work upon the dam they acted not exactly
in harmony but in amicable rivalry, all being
watchful and all industrious.</p>
<p>In the under-water world of the beaver pond the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
light from the cloudless autumn sun was tawny
gold, now still as crystal, now quivering over the
bottom in sudden dancing meshes of fine shadow
as some faint puff of air wrinkled the surface.
When the dam was first built the pond had been of
proper depth&ndash;&ndash;from three to four feet&ndash;&ndash;only in
the channel of the stream; while all the rest was
shallow, the old, marshy levels of the shore submerged
to a depth of perhaps not more than twelve
or fifteen inches. Gradually, however, the industrious
dam-builders had dug away these shallows,
using the material&ndash;&ndash;grass, roots, clay, and stones&ndash;&ndash;for
the broadening and solidifying of the dam.
The tough fibred masses of grass-roots, full of clay
and almost indestructible, were just such material
as they loved to work with, the ancient difficulty of
making bricks without straw being well known to
them. Over a large portion of the pond the bottom
was now clean sand and mud, offering no obstacle
to the transportation of cuttings to the houses or
the dam.</p>
<p>The beavers, moving hither and thither through
this glimmering golden underworld, swam with
their powerful hind feet only, which drove them
through the water like wedges. Their little forefeet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
with flexible, almost handlike paws, were carried
tucked up snugly under their chins, while their
huge, broad, flat, hairless tails stuck straight out
behind, ready to be used as a powerful screw in
case of any sudden need. Presently two of the
swimmers, apparently by chance, came upon the
body of the beaver which the journeying otter had
slain. They knew that it was contrary to the laws
of the clan that any dead thing should be left in
the pond to poison the waters in its decay. Without
ceremony or sentiment they proceeded to drag
their late comrade toward shore,&ndash;&ndash;or rather to
shove it ahead of them, only dragging when it got
stuck against some stone or root. At the very edge
of the pond, where the water was not more than
eight or ten inches deep, they left it, to be thrust
out and far up the bank after nightfall. They knew
that some hungry night prowler would then take
care of it for them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile an industriously inclined beaver had
made his way to the very head of the pond. Here
he entered a little ditch or canal which led off
through a wild meadow in a perfectly straight line,
toward a wooded slope some fifty yards or so from
the pond. This ditch, which was perhaps two feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
and a half deep and about the same in width, looked
as if it had been dug by the hand of man. The
materials taken from it had been thrown up along
the brink, but not on one side only, as the human
ditch-digger does it. The beavers had thrown it
out on both sides. The ditch was of some age, however,
so the wild grasses and weeds had completely
covered the two parallel ridges and now leaned low
over the water, partly hiding it. Under this screen
the beaver came to the surface, and swam noiselessly
with his head well up.</p>
<p>At the edge of the slope the canal turned sharply
to the left, and ran in a gradual curve, skirting the
upland. Here it was a piece of new work, raw and
muddy, and the little ridges of fresh earth and
roots along its brink were conspicuous. The beaver
now went very cautiously, sniffing the air for any
hint of peril. After winding along for some twenty
or thirty yards, the new canal shoaled out to nothingness
behind a screen of alder; and here, in a
mess of mud and water, the beaver found one of
his comrades hard at work. There was much of
the new canal yet to do, and winter coming on.</p>
<p>The object of this new ditch was to tap a new
food supply. The food trees near enough to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
pond to be felled into it or rolled down to it had
long ago been used. Then the straight canal across
the meadow to the foot of the upland had opened up
a new area, an area rich in birch and poplar. But
trees can be rolled easily down-hill that cannot be
dragged along an uneven side-hill; so, at last, it
had become necessary to extend the canal parallel
with the bottom of the slope. Working in this direction,
every foot of new ditch brought a lot of
new supplies within reach.</p>

&ldquo;STICKY LUMPS, WHICH THEY COULD HUG UNDER THEIR CHINS.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>The extremity of the canal was dug on a slant,
for greater ease in removing the material. Here
the two beavers toiled side by side, working independently.
With their teeth they cut the tough sod
as cleanly as a digger&rsquo;s spade could do it. With
their fore paws they scraped up the soil&ndash;&ndash;which
was soft and easily worked&ndash;&ndash;into sticky lumps,
which they could hug under their chins and carry
up the slope to be dumped upon the grass at the
side. Every minute one or the other would stop,
lift his brown head over the edge, peer about, and
sniff, and listen, then fall to work again furiously,
as if the whole future and fortune of the pond were
hanging upon his toil. After a half-hour&rsquo;s labour
the canal was lengthened very perceptibly&ndash;&ndash;fully
six or eight inches&ndash;&ndash;and as if by common consent
the two brown excavators stopped to refresh themselves
by nibbling at some succulent roots. While
they were thus occupied, and apparently absorbed,
from somewhere up the slope among the birch-trees
came the faint sound of a snapping twig. In half
a second the beavers had vanished noiselessly under
water, down the canal, leaving but a swirl of muddy
foam to mark their going.

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />Night Watchers</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/W.png" title="" alt="W" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_13'><span class="dcap">WHEN</span> the Boy came creeping down the
hillside, and found the water in the canal
still muddy and foaming, he realized that
he had just missed a chance to see the beavers actually
at work on their ditch-digging. He was
disappointed. But he found ample compensation
in the fact that here was one of the much-discussed
and sometimes doubted canals, actually in process
of construction. He knew he could outdo the beavers
in their own game of wariness and watchfulness.
He made up his mind he would lie out that
very night, on the hillside close by&ndash;&ndash;and so patiently,
so unstirringly, that the beavers would
never suspect the eager eyes that were upon them.</p>
</div>
<p>All around him, on the nearer slopes, were evidences
of the purpose for which the canal was designed,
as well as of the diligence with which the
little people of the pond were labouring to get in
their winter stores. From this diligence, so early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
in the season, the Boy argued an early and severe
winter. He found trees of every size up to two
feet in diameter cleanly felled, and stripped of their
branches. With two or three exceptions&ndash;&ndash;probably
the work of young beavers unskilled in their
art&ndash;&ndash;the trees were felled unerringly in the direction
of the water, so as to minimize the labour of
dragging down the cuttings. Close to the new part
of the canal, he found the tree whose falling he and
Jabe had heard the night before. It was a tall yellow
birch, fully twenty inches through at the place
where it was cut, some fifteen inches from the
ground. The cutting was still fresh and sappy.
About half the branches had been gnawed off and
trimmed, showing that the beavers, after being disturbed
by the Boy&rsquo;s visit to the dam, had returned
to work later in the night. Much of the smaller
brush, from the top, had been cleared away and
dragged down to the edge of the canal. As the Boy
knew, from what trappers and woodsmen had told
him, this brush, and a lot more like it, would all
be anchored in a huge pile in mid-channel, a little
above the dam, where it would serve the double
purpose of breaking the force of the floods and of
supplying food through the winter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>Very near the newly felled birch the Boy found
another large tree about half cut through; and he
vowed to himself that he would see the finish of
that job that very night. He found the cutting
done pretty evenly all around the tree, but somewhat
lower and deeper on the side next to the water.
In width the cut was less than that which a good
axeman would make&ndash;&ndash;because the teeth of a
beaver are a more frugal cutting instrument than
the woodsman&rsquo;s axe, making possible a straighter
and less wasteful cut. At the foot of this tree he
picked up chips fully eight inches in length, and
was puzzled to imagine how the beavers imitated
the effect of the axe in making the chips fly off.</p>
<p>For a couple of hours the Boy busied himself
joyously, observing the work of these cunning
woodsmen&rsquo;s teeth, noting the trails by which the
remoter cuttings had been dragged down to the
water, and studying the excavations on the canal.
Then, fearing to make the little citizens of the pond
so nervous that they might not come out to business
that night, he withdrew over the slope and made his
way back to camp. He would sleep out the rest
of the afternoon to be fresh and keen for the night&rsquo;s
watching.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>At supper that evening, beside the camp-fire,
when the woods looked magical under the still,
white moon, Jabe Smith gradually got fired with
the Boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm. The Boy&rsquo;s descriptions of
the canal digging, of the structure of the dam, and,
above all, of the battle between the otter and the
beavers, filled him with a new eagerness to observe
these wonderful little engineers with other eyes
than those of the mere hunter and trapper. In the
face of all the Boy&rsquo;s exact details he grew almost
deferential, quite laying aside his usual backwoods
pose of indifference and half derision. He made
no move to go to bed, but refilled his pipe and
watched his young comrade&rsquo;s face with shrewd,
bright eyes grown suddenly boyish.</p>
<p>At last the Boy rose and picked up his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must hurry up and get myself hidden,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll see nothing to-night. Good night, Jabe.
I&rsquo;ll not be back, likely, till along toward morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The backwoodsman&rsquo;s usual response was not
forthcoming. For some seconds he fingered his
rugged chin in silence. Then, straightening himself
up, he spoke with an air of mingled embarrassment
and carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them beaver of yourn&rsquo;s certainly an interestin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
kind of varmint. D&rsquo;ye know, blam&rsquo;d if I ain&rsquo;t got
a notion to go along with you to-night, an&rsquo; watch
&rsquo;em myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy, though secretly delighted at this evidence
of something like conversion, eyed Jabe
doubtfully. He was not sure of the latter&rsquo;s capacity
for the tireless patience and long self-effacement
necessary for such an adventure as this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jabe,&rdquo; he answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;you
know well how more than glad I&rsquo;d be of your company.
It would just about double my fun, having
you along, if you were really interested, as I am,
you know. And are you sure you could keep still
long enough to see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jabe would have resented this halting acceptance
of his companionship had he not known in his heart
that it was nothing more than he well deserved.
But the doubt cast upon his woodcraft piqued him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t I never set for hours in the wet ma&rsquo;sh,
never movin&rsquo; a finger, waitin&rsquo; for the geese?&rdquo; he
asked with injury in his voice. &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t I never
sneaked up on a watchin&rsquo; buck, or laid so still I&rsquo;ve
fooled a bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy chuckled softly at this outbreak, so
unexpected in the taciturn and altogether superior
Jabe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Jabe!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I reckon
you can keep still. But you must let me be captain,
for to-night! This is my trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartain,&rdquo; responded the woodsman with alacrity.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat mud if you say so! But I&rsquo;ll take
along a hunk of cold bacon if you hain&rsquo;t got no
objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the trail through the ghostly, moonlit woods,
Jabe followed obediently at the Boy&rsquo;s heels. Silently
as shadows they moved, silently as the lynx
or the moose or the weasel goes through the softly
parting undergrowth. The Boy led far away from
the brook, and over the crest of the ridge, to avoid
alarming the vigilant sentries. As they approached
the head of the canal, their caution redoubled, and
they went very slowly, bending low and avoiding
every patch of moonlight. The light breeze, so
light as to be almost imperceptible, drew upward
toward them from the meadow, bringing now and
then a scent of the fresh-dug soil. At last the Boy
lay down on his belly; and Jabe religiously imitated
him. For perhaps fifty yards they crept forward
inch by inch, till at length they found themselves
in the heart of a young fir thicket, through whose
branches they could look out upon the head of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
canal and the trees where the beavers had most
recently been cutting.</p>
<p>Among the trees and in the water, all was still,
with the mystic, crystalline stillness of the autumn
moonlight. In that light everything seemed fragile
and unreal, as if a movement or a breath might
dissolve it. After a waiting of some ten minutes
Jabe had it on the tip of his tongue to whisper, derisively,
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;!&rdquo; But he remembered the
Boy&rsquo;s injunction, as well as his doubts, and checked
himself. A moment later a faint, swirling gurgle
of water caught his ear, and he was glad he had
kept silence. An instant more, and the form of a
beaver, spectral-gray in the moonlight, took shape
all at once on the brink of the canal. For several
minutes it stood there motionless, erect upon its
hind quarters, questioning the stillness with eyes
and ear and nose. Then, satisfied that there was
no danger near, it dropped on all fours and crept
up toward the tree that was partly cut through.</p>
<p>This pioneer of the woodcutters was followed
immediately by three others, who lost no time in
getting down to work. One of them went to help
the leader, while the other two devoted themselves
to trimming and cutting up the branches of the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
birch which they had felled the night before. The
Boy wondered where the rest of the pond-people
were, and would have liked to consult Jabe about
it; but he remembered the keenness of the beaver&rsquo;s
ears, and held his tongue securely. It seemed to
him probably that they were still down in the pond,
working on the houses, the brush pile, or the dam.
Presently one more was accounted for. A renewed
splashing in the canal turned the attention of the
watchers from the tree-cutting, and they saw that
a single wise excavator was at work, carrying forward
the head of the ditch.</p>
<p>There was no impatience or desire to fidget left
in Jabe Smith now. As he watched the beavers at
work in the moonlight, looking very mysterious in
their stealthy, busy, tireless diligence, and conducting
their toil with an ordered intelligence which
seemed to him almost human, he understood for the
first time the Boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm for this kind of
bloodless hunting. He had always known how
clever the beavers were, and allowed them full
credit; but till now he had never actually realized
it. The two beavers engaged in cutting down the
tree sat erect upon their haunches, supported by
their huge tails, chiseling indefatigably. Cutting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
two deep grooves, one about six or eight inches,
perhaps, above the other, they would then wrench
off the chips by main force with their teeth and
forepaws, jerking their powerful necks with a
kind of furious impatience. As he noted how
they made the cut deeper and lower on one side
than the other, that the tree might fall as they
wished, he was so delighted that he came dangerously
near vowing he would never trap a beaver
again. He felt that it was almost like ensnaring
a brother woodsman.</p>
<p>Equally exciting was the work on the other tree,
which was being trimmed. The branches, according
to their size, were cut into neat, manageable
lengths, of from three to six or seven feet&ndash;&ndash;the
less the diameter the greater the length, each piece
being calculated to be handled in the water by one
beaver. These pieces were then rolled, shoved or
dragged, as the case might require, down the
smooth trails already made in hauling the brush,
and dumped into the canal. Other beavers presently
appeared, and began towing the sticks and
brush down the canal to the pond. This part of
the process was hidden from the eager watchers in
the thicket; but the Boy guessed, from his own
experience in pushing a log endwise before him
while in swimming, that the beavers would handle
the sticks in the same way. With the brush, however,
it was different. In hauling it down the trail
each beaver took a branch in his teeth, by the butt,
twisted it across his shoulders, and let it drag behind
him. It was obvious that in the water, too, this
would be the most convenient way to handle such
material. The beavers were not the kind of people
to waste their strength in misdirected effort.</p>

&ldquo;TWISTED IT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS, AND LET IT DRAG BEHIND HIM.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>While all this cutting and hauling was going on,
the big beaver down at the head of the canal was attending
strictly to his task, running his lines
straight, digging the turf and clay, shoving his
loads up the slope and out upon the edge of the
ditch. The process was all in clear, easy view of
the watchers, their place of hiding being not more
than eight or ten paces distant.</p>
<p>They had grown altogether absorbed in watching
the little canal-builder, when a cracking sound made
them turn their eyes. The tree was toppling slowly.
Every beaver now made a mad rush for the canal,
not caring how much noise he made&ndash;&ndash;and plunged
into the water. Slowly, reluctantly, majestically,
the tall birch swung forward straight down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
slope, its top describing a great arc against the sky
and gathering the air in its branches with a low
but terrifying roar. The final crash was unexpectedly
gentle,&ndash;&ndash;or rather, would have seemed so to
one unfamiliar with tree-felling. Some branches
snapped, some sticks flew up and dropped, there
was a shuddering confusion in the crystal air for a
few seconds, then the stillness fell once more.</p>
<p>But now there was not a beaver to be seen. Jabe
wondered if they had been scared by the results of
their own work; or if one of their sentinels had
come and peered into the thicket from the rear. As
minute after minute dragged by, and nothing happened,
he began to realize that his muscles were
aching savagely from their long restraint. He was
on the point of moving, of whispering to ask the
Boy what it meant, when the latter, divining his
unrest, stealthily laid a restraining hand upon his
arm. He guessed that the beavers were on the alert,
hiding, and watching to see if any of their enemies
should be attracted by the noise.</p>

&ldquo;EVERY BEAVER NOW MADE A MAD RUSH FOR THE CANAL.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>Not five seconds later, however, he forgot his
aches. Appearing with uncanny and inexplicable
suddenness, there was the big pioneer again, sitting
up by the edge of the canal. As before, he sat absolutely
motionless for a minute or two, sniffing
and listening. Then, satisfied once more that all
was well, he moved lazily up the slope to examine
the tree; and in half a minute all were at work
again, except that there was no more tree-felling.
The great business of the hour was cutting brush.</p>
<p>For some time longer the watchers lay motionless,
noting every detail of the work, till at last the
Boy began to think it was time to release Jabe from
his long and severe restraint and break up the
beaver &ldquo;chopping-bee.&rdquo; Before he had quite made
up his mind, however, his eyes chanced to wander
a little way up the slope, and to rest, without any
conscious purpose, on a short gray bit of log.
Presently he began to wonder what a piece of log
so short and thick&ndash;&ndash;not much more than three
feet long&ndash;&ndash;would be doing there. No beavers
would waste time cutting up a twelve-inch log into
lengths like that. And there had been no lumberman
in the neighbourhood. Then, in a flash, his
eyes cleared themselves of their illusion. The log
had moved, ever so slightly. It was no longer a
log, but a big gray lynx, creeping slowly, inexorably,
down upon the unsuspecting people of the
pond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>For perhaps ten seconds the Boy stared in uncertainty.
Then he saw the lynx gather his muscles
for the final, fatal rush. Without a whisper or a
warning to the astonished Jabe, he whipped up his
rifle, and fired.</p>
<p>The sharp report seemed to shatter the whole
scene. Its echoes were mixed with the scattering
of the horrified beavers as they rushed for the
water&ndash;&ndash;with the short screech of the lynx, as it
bounced into the air and fell back on its side, dead&ndash;&ndash;with
an exclamation of astonishment from Jabe&ndash;&ndash;and
with a crashing of branches just behind the
thicket. The Boy looked around, triumphant&ndash;&ndash;to
see that Jabe&rsquo;s exclamation was not at all the result
of his clever shot. The woodsman was on his
hands and knees, his back turned, and staring at the
form of a big black bear as it lumbered off in a
panic through the bushes. Like the unfortunate
lynx, the bear had been stalking the beavers on his
own account, and had almost stepped upon the
silent watchers in the thicket.</p>

<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">AS</span> the Boy trudged triumphantly back
toward camp, over the crest of the moon-bright
ridge, he carried the limp, furry
body of the lynx slung by its hind legs over his
shoulder. He felt that his prestige had gone up
incalculably in the woodsman&rsquo;s eyes. The woodsman
was silent, however, as silent as the wilderness,
till they descended the other slope and came
in sight of the little solitary camp. Then he said:
&ldquo;That was a mighty slick shot of yourn, d&rsquo;ye know
it? Ye&rsquo;re quicker&rsquo;n chain lightnin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; dead on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just luck, Jabe!&rdquo; replied the Boy carelessly,

trouble to controvert. He knew the Boy did not
mean it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought as how ye wouldn&rsquo;t kill anything?&rdquo;
he went on, teasingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Had to!&rdquo; retorted the Boy. &ldquo;That was self-defence!
Those beavers are my beavers. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
always wanted a real good excuse for getting a
good lynx skin, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame ye a mite fer standin&rsquo; by them
beaver!&rdquo; continued Jabe. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re jest all right!
It was better&rsquo;n any circus; an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know when
I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the least you can do, Jabe, is promise not
to trap any more beavers!&rdquo; said the Boy quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; answered Jabe, as they entered camp
and began spreading their blankets, &ldquo;leastwise I&rsquo;ll
do my best to see that no harm comes to them
beaver, nor to the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning, as the woodsman was starting
out for the day&rsquo;s cruise, the Boy said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re game for another night&rsquo;s watching,
Jabe, I&rsquo;ll show you something altogether different
up at the pond to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; responded the woodsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be back earlier than usual, then,&rdquo;
said the Boy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get hidden earlier,
and in a new place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back along a couple of hours afore
sundown, then,&rdquo; answered Jabe, swinging off on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
his long, mooselike stride. It was contrary to his
backwoods etiquette to ask what was in store for
him; but his curiosity was excited, and kept him
company through the solitude all day.</p>
<p>When Jabe was gone, the Boy went straight up-stream
to the dam, taking no special care to hide
his coming. His plan was one in regard to which
he felt some guilty qualms. But he consoled himself
with the thought that whatever harm he might be
doing to the little citizens of the pond would be
more than compensated by the protection he was
giving them. He was going to make a break in the
dam, for the sake of seeing just how the beavers
would mend it.</p>
<p>On reaching the dam, however, it occurred to
him that if he made the break now the beavers
might regard the matter as too urgent to be left
till nightfall. They might steal a march on him
by mending the damage little by little, surreptitiously,
through the day. He had no way of knowing
just how they would take so serious a danger
as a break in their dam. He decided, therefore, to
postpone his purpose till the afternoon, so that the
beavers would not come to the rescue too early.
In the meantime, he would explore the stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
above the pond, and see if there were other communities
to study.</p>
<p>Skirting the hither side of the pond to near its
head, he crossed the little meadow and the canal,
and reached the brook again about fifty yards beyond.
Here he found it flowing swift and narrow,
over a rocky bottom, between high banks; and this
was its character for nearly half a mile, as he
judged. Then, emerging once more upon lower
ground, he came upon a small dam. This structure
was not much over eighteen inches in height, and
the pond above it, small and shallow, showed no
signs of being occupied. There was no beaver
house to be seen, either in the water or on shore;
and the water did not seem to be anywhere more
than a foot and a half in depth. As he puzzled
over this&ndash;&ndash;for he did not think the beavers were
likely to build a dam for nothing&ndash;&ndash;he observed
a second and much larger dam far away across the
head of the pond.</p>
<p>Hastening to investigate this upper dam, he
found it fully three feet high, and very massive.
Above it was a narrow but deep pond, between comparatively
steep shores; and along these shores he
counted three low-roofed houses. Out in the middle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
of the pond there was not one dwelling; and he
came presently to the conclusion that here, between
the narrow banks, the current would be heavy in
time of freshet. The lower dam, pretty obviously,
was intended to reinforce the upper, by backing a
foot and a half of water against it and taking off
just that much of the pressure. He decided that
the reason for locating the three houses along the
shore was that the steep bank afforded special facilities
for shore burrows.</p>
<p>The explorer&rsquo;s fever being now hot upon him,
the Boy could not stay to examine this pond minutely.
He pressed on up-stream with breathless
eagerness, thrilling with expectation of what the
next turn might reveal. As a matter of fact, the
next turn revealed nothing&ndash;&ndash;nor the next, nor yet
the next. But as the stream was full of turns in
this portion of its course, that was not greatly discouraging.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile, however, above the
head of the narrow pond, the ardent explorer came
upon a level of sparse alder swamp. Here he found
the stream just beginning to spread over its low
banks. The cause of this spreading was a partial
obstruction in mid-channel&ndash;&ndash;what looked, at first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
glance, like an accidental accumulation of brush
and stones and mud. A second look, however, and
his heart jumped with excitement and delight.
Here was the beginning of a new pond, here were
the foundations of a new dam. He would be able
to see what few indeed of the students of the wilderness
had had the opportunity to watch&ndash;&ndash;the
actual process by which these wilderness engineers
achieved their great work.</p>
<p>All about the place the straightest and brushiest
alders had been cut down, those usually selected
being at least ten or twelve feet in height. Many
of them were still lying where they fell; but a
number had been dragged to the stream and anchored
securely, with stones and turfy clay, across
the channel. The Boy noted, with keenest admiration,
that these were all laid with the greatest regularity
parallel with the flow of the current, butts
up stream, brushy tops below. In this way, the
current took least hold upon them, and was obstructed
gradually and as it were insidiously, without
being challenged to any violent test of strength.
Already it was lingering in some confusion, backing
up, and dividing its force, and stealing away at
each side among the bushes. The Boy had heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
that the beavers were accustomed to begin their
dams by felling a tree across the channel and piling
their materials upon that as a foundation. But the
systematic and thorough piece of work before him
was obviously superior in permanence to any such
slovenly makeshift; and moreover, further to discredit
such a theory, here was a tall black ash close
to the stream and fairly leaning over it, as if begging
to be put to some such use.</p>
<p>At this spot the Boy stayed his explorations for
the day. Choosing a bit of dry thicket close by,
to be a hiding-place for Jabe and himself that
night, a bunch of spruce and fir where he knew the
beavers would not come for supplies, he hurried
back to the camp for a bite of dinner, giving wide
berth to all the ponds on the way. Building a tiny
camp-fire he fried himself a couple of slices of
bacon and brewed a tin of tea for his solitary meal,
then lay down in the lean-to, with the sun streaming
in upon him, for an hour&rsquo;s nap.</p>
<p>The night having been a tiring one for his youthful
nerves and muscles, he slept heavily, and awoke
with a start to find the sun a good two hours nearer
the horizon. Sleep was still heavy upon him, so he
went down to the edge of the brook and plunged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
his face into the chilly current. Then, picking up
an axe instead of his rifle, he returned up-stream
to the dam.</p>
<p>As he drew near, he caught sight of a beaver
swimming down the pond, towing a big branch
over its shoulder; and his conscience smote him
at the thought of the trouble and anxiety he was
going to inflict upon the diligent little inhabitants.
His mind was made up, however. He wanted
knowledge, and the beavers would have to furnish
it, at whatever cost. A few minutes of vigorous
work with the axe, a few minutes of relentless
tugging and jerking upon the upper framework of
the dam, and he had made a break through which
the water rushed foaming in a muddy torrent.
Soon, as he knew, the falling of the pond&rsquo;s level
would alarm the house-dwellers, and bring them out
to see what had happened. Then, as soon as darkness
came, there would be a gathering of both
households to repair the break.</p>

&ldquo;HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A BEAVER SWIMMING DOWN THE POND.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>Hiding in the bushes near by, he saw the water
slowly go down, but for half an hour the beavers
gave no sign. Then, close beside the break, a big
fellow crawled out upon the slope of the dam and
made a careful survey of the damage. He disappeared;
and presently another came, took a
briefer look, and vanished. A few minutes later,
far up the pond, several bushy branches came to
the surface, as if they had been anchored on the
bottom and released. They came, apparently floating,
down toward the dam. As they reached the
break, the heads of several beavers showed themselves
above water, and the branches were guided
across the opening, where they were secured in
some way which the watcher could not see. They
did not so very greatly diminish the waste, but they
checked the destructive violence of it. It was evidently
a temporary makeshift, this; for in the
next hour nothing more was done. Then the Boy
got tired, and went back to camp to wait for Jabe
and nightfall.</p>
<p>That evening the backwoodsman, forgetting the
fatigue of his day&rsquo;s cruising in the interest of the
Boy&rsquo;s story, was no less eager than his companion;
and the two, hurrying through an early supper,
were off for the pond in the first purple of twilight.
When they reached the Boy&rsquo;s hiding-place by the
dam the first star was just showing itself in the
pallid greenish sky, and the surface of the pond,
with its vague, black reflections, was like a shadowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
mirror of steel. There was not a sound on
the air except the swishing rush of the divided
water over the break in the dam.</p>
<p>The Boy had timed his coming none too early;
for the pond had dropped nearly a foot, and the
beavers were impatient to stop the break. No
sooner had night fairly settled down than suddenly
the water began to swirl into circles all about the
lower end of the pond, and a dozen heads popped
up. Then more brush appeared, above the island-house,
and was hurriedly towed down to the dam.
The brush which had been thrust across the break
was now removed and relaid longitudinally,
branchy ends down stream. Here it was held in
place by some of the beavers while others brought
masses of clayey turf from the nearest shore to
secure it. Meanwhile more branches were being
laid in place, always parallel with the current; and
in a little while the rushing noise of the overflow
began to diminish very noticeably. Then a number
of short, heavy billets were mixed with shorter
lengths of brush; and all at once the sound of
rushing ceased altogether. There was not even
the usual musical trickling and tinkling, for the
level of the pond was too low for the water to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
its customary stealthy exits. At this stage the
engineers began using smaller sticks, with more
clay, and a great many small stones, making a very
solid-looking piece of work. At last the old level
of the dam crest was reached, and there was no
longer any evidence of what had happened except
the lowness of the water. Then, all at once, the
toilers disappeared, except for one big beaver, who
kept nosing over every square inch of the work for
perhaps two minutes, to assure himself of its perfection.
When he, at last, had slipped back into
the water, both Jabe and the Boy got up, as if
moved by one thought, and stretched their cramped
legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan!&rdquo; exclaimed the woodsman with fervour.
&ldquo;If that ain&rsquo;t the slickest bit o&rsquo; work I ever
seen! Let&rsquo;s go over and kind of inspect the job
fer &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspection revealed that the spot which had just
been mended was the solidest portion of the whole
structure. Wherever else the water might be allowed
to escape, it was plain the beavers intended
it should have no more outlet here.</p>
<p>From the mended dam the Boy now led Jabe
away up-stream in haste, in the hope of catching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
some beavers at work on the new dam in the alders.
Having skirted the long pond at a distance, to avoid
giving alarm, the travellers went with the utmost
caution till they reached the swampy level. Then,
indifferent to the oozy, chilly mud, they crept forward
like minks stealing on their prey; and at last,
gaining the fir thicket without mishap, they lay
prone on the dry needles to rest.</p>
<p>As they lay, a sound of busy splashing came to
their ears, which promptly made them forget their
fatigue. Shifting themselves very slowly and with
utter silence, they found that the place of ambush
had been most skilfully chosen. In perfect hiding
themselves, they commanded a clear and near view
of the new dam and all its approaches.</p>
<p>There were two beavers visible, paddling busily
on the foundations of the dam, while the overflowing
water streamed about them, covering their feet.
At this stage, most of the water flowed through
the still uncompacted structure, leaving work on the
top unimpeded. The two beavers were dragging
into place a long birch sapling, perhaps eleven feet
in length, with a thick, bushy top. When laid to
the satisfaction of the architects,&ndash;&ndash;the butt, of
course, pointing straight up-stream,&ndash;&ndash;the trunk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
was jammed firmly down between those already
placed. Then the more erect and unmanageable of
the branches were gnawed off and in some way&ndash;&ndash;which
the observers with all their watchfulness
could not make out&ndash;&ndash;wattled down among the
other branches so as to make a woven and coherent
mass. The earth and sod and small stones which
were afterwards brought and laid upon the structure
did not seem necessary to hold it in place, but
rather for the stoppage of the interstices.</p>
<p>While this was going on at the dam, a rustling
of branches and splashing of water turned the
watchers&rsquo; attention up-stream. Another beaver
came in sight, and then another, each partly floating
and partly dragging a straight sapling like
the first. It seemed that the dam-builders were
not content to depend altogether on the crooked,
scraggly alder-growth all about them, but demanded
in their foundations a certain proportion
of the straighter timbers and denser branches of
the birch. It was quite evident that they knew
just what they were doing, and how best to do it.</p>
<p>While the building was going on, yet another
pair of beavers appeared, and the work was pressed
with a feverish energy that produced amazing results.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
The Boy remembered a story told him by
an old Indian, but not confirmed by any natural
history which he had come across, to the effect that
when a pair of young beavers set out to establish
a new pond, some of the old ones go along to lend
a hand in the building of the dam. It was plain
that these workers were all in a tremendous hurry;
and the Boy could see no reason for haste unless
it was that the majority of the workers had to get
back to their own affairs. With the water once
fairly brought under control, and the pond deep
enough to afford a refuge from enemies, the young
pair could be trusted to complete it by themselves,
get their house ready, and gather their supplies in
for the winter. The Boy concluded to his own satisfaction
that what he was now watching was the
analogue, in beaver life, to one of those &ldquo;house-raising&rdquo;
bees which sometimes took place in the
Settlement, when the neighbours would come together
to help a man get up the frame of a new
house. Only, as it seemed to him, the beavers were
a more serious and more sober folk than the men.</p>
<p>When this wilderness engineering had progressed
for an hour under the watchers&rsquo; eyes, Jabe began
to grow very tired. The strain of physical immobility
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
told upon him, and he lost interest. He began
to feel that he knew all about dam-building; and
as there was nothing more to learn he wanted to
go back to camp. He glanced anxiously at the
young face beside him&ndash;&ndash;but there he could see
no sign of weariness. The Boy was aglow with
enthusiasm. He had forgotten everything but the
wonderful little furry architects, their diligence,
their skill, their co&ouml;peration, and the new pond
there growing swiftly before his eyes. Already it
was more than twice as wide as when they had
arrived on the scene; the dam was a good eight
inches higher; and the clamour of the flowing
stream was stopped. No, Jabe could see no sympathy
for himself in that eager face. He was
ashamed to beg off. And moreover, he was loyal
to his promise of obedience. The Boy, here, was
Captain.</p>
<p>Suppressing a sigh, Jabe stealthily and very
gradually shifted to an easier position, so stealthily
that the Boy beside him did not know he had
moved. Then, fixing his eyes once more upon the
beavers, he tried to renew his interest in them. As
he stared, he began to succeed amazingly. And no
wonder! The beavers all at once began to do such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
amazing things. There were many more of them
than he had thought; and he was sure he heard
them giving orders in something that sounded to
him like the Micmac tongue. He could not believe
his ears. Then he saw that they were using larger
stones, instead of mud and turf, in their operations&ndash;&ndash;and
floating them down the pond as if they were
corks. He had never heard of such a thing before,
in all his wilderness experience. He was just about
to compliment the Boy on this unparalleled display
of engineering skill, when one particularly large
beaver, who was hoisting a stone as big as himself
up the face of the dam, let his burden slip a little.
Then began a terrible struggle between the beaver
and the stone. In his agonizing effort&ndash;&ndash;which
his companions all stopped work to watch&ndash;&ndash;the
unhappy beaver made a loud, gurgling, gasping
noise; then, without a hint of warning, dropped
the stone with a splash, turned like lightning, and
grabbed Jabe violently by the arm.</p>
<p>The astonishing scene changed in a twinkling;
and Jabe realized that the Boy was shaking him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice one to watch beavers, you are!&rdquo; cried
the Boy, angry and disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;ve they all gone to?&rdquo; demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Jabe, rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most interestin&rsquo;
critters I ever hearn tell of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting!&rdquo; retorted the Boy, scornfully.
&ldquo;So interesting you went to sleep! And you
snored so they thought it was an earthquake. Not
another beaver&rsquo;ll show a hair round here to-night.
We&rsquo;d better go home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jabe grinned sheepishly, but answered never a
word; and silently, in Indian file, the Boy leading,
the two took the trail back to camp.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />The Peril of the Traps</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/A.png" title="" alt="A" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">AT</span> breakfast next morning the Boy had
quite recovered his good humour, and
was making merry at Jabe&rsquo;s expense.
The latter, who was, of course, defenceless and
abashed, was anxious to give him something new
to think of.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, after the Boy
had prodded him with a searching jibe. &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;ll
let up on that snore, now, I&rsquo;ll take a day off from
my cruisin&rsquo;, and show ye somethin&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Boy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain. What
will you show me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take ye over to one of <i>my</i> ponds, in next
valley, an&rsquo; show ye all the different ways of <i>trappin&rsquo;</i>
beaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do <i>I</i> care about <i>trapping</i> beaver?&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;You know I wouldn&rsquo;t trap anything. If I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
had to kill anything, I&rsquo;d <i>shoot</i> it, and put it out
of misery as quick as I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; responded Jabe. &ldquo;But trappin&rsquo;
is somethin&rsquo; ye want to <i>understand</i>, all the
same. Ye can&rsquo;t be an all-round woodsman &rsquo;less ye
<i>understand</i> trappin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; moreover, there&rsquo;s some
things ye learn about wild critters in tryin&rsquo; to git
the better of &rsquo;em that ye can&rsquo;t learn no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Jabe!&rdquo; answered the Boy,
slowly. Knowledge he would have, whether he
liked the means of getting it or not. But the
woodsman&rsquo;s next words relieved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just show ye <i>how</i>, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; said Jabe.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a leetle too airly in the season yit fur actual
trappin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; moreover, it&rsquo;s agin the law. Agin
the law, an&rsquo; agin common sense, too, fer the fur
ain&rsquo;t no good, so to speak, fer a month yit. When
the law an&rsquo; common sense stand together, then I&rsquo;m
fer the law. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up his axe, he struck straight back into
the woods, in a direction at right angles to the
brook. To uninitiated eyes there was no trail; but
to Jabe, and to the Boy no less, the path was like
a trodden highway. The pace set by the backwoodsman,
with his long, slouching, loose-jointed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
flat-footed stride, was a stiff one, but the Boy, who
was lean and hard, and used his feet straight-toed
like an Indian, had no fault to find with it. Neither
spoke a word, as they swung along single file
through the high-arched and ancient forest, whose
shadows, so sombre all through summer, were now
shot here and there with sharp flashes of scarlet
or pale gleams of a&euml;rial gold. Once, rounding a
great rock of white granite stained with faint pinkish
and yellowish reflections from the bright leaves
glowing over it, they came face to face with a tall
bull moose, black and formidable-looking as some
antediluvian monster. The monster, however, had
no desire to hold the way against them. He eyed
them doubtfully for a second, and then went crashing
off through the brush in frank, undignified
alarm.</p>
<p>For a good three miles the travellers swung onward,
up a slow long slope, and down a longer,
slower one into the next valley. The Boy noted
that the region was one of numberless small brooks
flowing through a comparatively level land, with
old, long-deserted beaver-meadows interspersed
among wooded knolls. Yet for a time there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
no signs of the actual living beavers. He asked
the reason, and Jabe said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been all trapped over an&rsquo; over, years back,
when beaver pelts was high,&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; by Injuns, likely,
who just cleaned out everythin&rsquo;,&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; broke down
the dams,&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; dug out the houses. But the little
critters is comin&rsquo; back. Furder up the valley there&rsquo;s
some good ponds now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now they&rsquo;ll be cleaned out again!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Boy, with a rush of indignant pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on yer life!&rdquo; answered Jabe. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
do things that way now. We don&rsquo;t play low-down
tricks on &rsquo;em an&rsquo; clean out a whole family, but jest
take so many out of each beaver house, an&rsquo; then
leave &rsquo;em alone two er three years to kinder recooperate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jabe finished they came in sight of a long,
rather low dam, with a pond spread out beyond it
that was almost worthy to be called a lake. It was
of comparatively recent creation, as the Boy&rsquo;s observant
eye decided at once from the dead trees
still rising here and there from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, under his breath. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a great pond, Jabe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no less&rsquo;n four beaver houses in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
pond!&rdquo; said the woodsman, with an air of proud
possession. &ldquo;That makes, accordin&rsquo; to my reckonin&rsquo;,
anywheres from thirty to thirty-six beaver.
Bye and bye, when the time comes, I&rsquo;ll kinder thin
&rsquo;em out a bit, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the crest of the dam all four houses&ndash;&ndash;one
far out and three close to shore&ndash;&ndash;were visible to
the Boy&rsquo;s initiated eye; though strangers might
have taken them to be mere casual accumulations of
sticks deposited by some whimsical freshet. It
troubled him to think how many of the architects
of these cunningly devised dwellings would soon
have to yield up their harmless and interesting
lives; but he felt no mission to attempt a reform
of humanity&rsquo;s taste for furs, so he did not allow
himself to become sentimental on the subject. Beavers,
like men, must take fate as it comes; and
he turned an attentive ear to Jabe&rsquo;s lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know, of course,&rdquo; said the woodsman, &ldquo;the
steel trap we use. We ain&rsquo;t got no use fer the
tricks of the Injuns, though I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell ye all
<i>them</i>, in good time. An&rsquo; we ain&rsquo;t much on new-fangled
notions, neether. But the old, smooth-jawed
steel-trap, what kin <i>hold</i> when it gits a grip,
an&rsquo; not tear the fur, is good enough for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know all your traps, of all the sizes you
use, from muskrat up to bear!&rdquo; interrupted the
Boy. &ldquo;What size do you use for the beaver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number four,&rdquo; answered Jabe. &ldquo;Jaw&rsquo;s got a
spread of six and one-half inches or thereabouts.
But it&rsquo;s all in the where an&rsquo; the how ye set yer
trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I want to know about!&rdquo; said
the Boy. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you <i>shoot</i> the poor little
beggars? That&rsquo;s quicker for both, and just as easy
for you, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no use <i>shootin&rsquo;</i> a beaver, leastways not
in the water! He just sinks like a stone. No, ye&rsquo;ve
<i>got</i> to trap him, to <i>git</i> him. Now, supposin&rsquo; you
was goin&rsquo; to trap, where would ye set the traps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d anchor them just in the entrances to their
houses,&rdquo; answered the Boy promptly. &ldquo;Or along
their canals, when they&rsquo;ve got canals. Or round
their brush piles an&rsquo; storage heaps. And when I
found a tree they&rsquo;d just partly cut down, I&rsquo;d set
a couple of traps, covered up in leaves, each side of
the trunk, where they&rsquo;d have to step on the pan
when they stood up to gnaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; said Jabe, with cordial approbation.
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d make a first-class trapper, &rsquo;cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
ye&rsquo;ve got the right notion. Every one of them
things is done, one time or another, by the old
trapper. But here&rsquo;s one or two wrinkles more
killin&rsquo; yet. An&rsquo; moreover, if ye trap a beaver on
land ye&rsquo;re like to lose him one way or another.
He&rsquo;s got so much <i>purchase</i>, on land, with things
to git hold on to; he&rsquo;s jest as like as not to twist
his leg clean off, an&rsquo; git away. If it&rsquo;s one of his
fore legs, which is small an&rsquo; slight, ye know, he&rsquo;s
most sure to twist it off. An&rsquo; sometimes he&rsquo;ll do
the trick even with a hind leg. I&rsquo;ve caught lots of
beaver as had lost a fore leg, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t seem none
the worse. The fur&rsquo;d growed over it, an&rsquo; they was
slick an&rsquo; hearty. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve caught them as had lost
a hind leg, an&rsquo; they was in good condition. A
beaver&rsquo;ll stand a lot, I tell you. But then, supposin&rsquo;
you git yer beaver, caught so fast he ain&rsquo;t
no chance whatever to git clear. Then, like as not,
some lynx, or wildcat, or fisher, or fox, or even
maybe a bear, &rsquo;ll come along an&rsquo; help himself to Mr.
Beaver without so much as a by yer leave. No, ye
want to git him in the water; an&rsquo; as he&rsquo;s just as
anxious to git thar as you are to git him thar, that
suits all parties to a T.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Boy,&ndash;&ndash;not that it really
seemed to him good, but to show that he was attending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Jabe, &ldquo;what would ye say
would most upset the beaver and make &rsquo;em careless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy thought for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breaking their dam!&rdquo; he answered tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eg</i>zactly!&rdquo; answered the woodsman. &ldquo;Well,
now, to ketch beaver sure, make two or three breaks
in their dam, an&rsquo; set the traps jest a leetle ways
above the break, on the upper slope, where they&rsquo;re
sure to step into &rsquo;em when hustlin&rsquo; round to mend
the damage. That gits &rsquo;em, every time. Ye chain
each trap to a stake, driven into three or four foot
of water; an&rsquo; ye drive another stake about a foot
an&rsquo; a half away from the first. When the beaver
finds himself caught, he dives straight for deep
water,&ndash;&ndash;his way of gittin&rsquo; clear of most of his
troubles. But this time he finds it don&rsquo;t work. The
trap keeps a holt, bitin&rsquo; hard. An&rsquo; in his struggle
he gits the chain all tangled up &rsquo;round the two
stakes, an&rsquo; drowns himself. There you have him
safe, where no lynx nor fox kin git at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when one of them dies so dreadfully,
right there before their eyes,&rdquo; said the Boy, &ldquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
suppose the others skin out and let the broken dam
go! They must be scared to death themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on yer life, they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; responded Jabe.
&ldquo;The dam&rsquo;s the thing they care about. They jest
keep on hustlin&rsquo; round; an&rsquo; they mend up that dam
if it takes half the beaver in the pond to do it. Oh,
they&rsquo;re grit, all right, when it comes to standin&rsquo; by
the dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly seems fair to take them that way, does
it?&rdquo; mused the Boy sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good way,&rdquo; asserted Jabe positively,
&ldquo;quick an&rsquo; sure! Then, in winter there&rsquo;s another
good an&rsquo; sure way,&ndash;&ndash;where ye don&rsquo;t want to
clean out the whole house, which is killin&rsquo; the goose
what lays the golden egg, like the Injuns does! Ye
cut a hole in the ice, near the bank. Then ye git
a good, big, green sapling of birch or willow, run
the little end &rsquo;way out into the pond under the ice,
an&rsquo; ram the big end, sharpened, deep into the mud
of the bank, so the beaver can&rsquo;t pull it out. Right
under this end you set yer trap. Swimmin&rsquo; round
under the ice, beaver comes across this fresh-cut
sapling an&rsquo; thinks as how he&rsquo;s got a good thing.
He set right to work to gnaw it off, close to the
bank, to take it back to the house an&rsquo; please the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
family. First thing, he steps right into the trap.
An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the end of him. But other beaver&rsquo;ll come
along an&rsquo; take the sapling, all the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of the ways the Indians had, of
cleaning out the whole family,&rdquo; suggested the Boy,
when Jabe had come to a long pause, either because
he was tired of talking or because he had no more
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Injuns&rsquo; methods was complete. They
seemed to have the idee there&rsquo;d always be beaver
a-plenty, no matter how many they killed. One way
they had was to mark down the bank holes, the burrows,
an&rsquo; then break open the houses. This, ye
must understand, &rsquo;s in the winter, when there&rsquo;s ice
all over the pond. When they&rsquo;re drove from their
houses, in the winter, they take straight to their
burrows in the bank, where they kin be sure of
gittin&rsquo; their heads above water to breathe. Then,
the Injuns jest drive stakes down in front of the
holes,&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; there they have &rsquo;em, every one. They
digs down into the burrows, an&rsquo; knocks Mr. Beaver
an&rsquo; all the family on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple and expeditious!&rdquo; remarked the Boy,
with sarcastic approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the nestest job the Injuns makes,&rdquo; continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Jabe, &ldquo;is by gittin&rsquo; at the brush pile. Ye
know, the beaver keeps his winter supply of grub
in a pile,&ndash;&ndash;a pile of green poles an&rsquo; saplings an&rsquo;
branches,&ndash;&ndash;a leetle ways off from the house. The
Injun finds this pile, under the ice. Then, cuttin&rsquo;
holes through the ice, he drives down a stake fence
all &rsquo;round it, so close nary a beaver kin git through.
Then he pulls up a stake, on the side next the
beaver house, an&rsquo; sticks down a bit of a sliver in
its place. Now ye kin guess what happens. In
the house, over beyant, the beavers gits hungry.
One on &rsquo;em goes to git a stick from the pile an&rsquo;
bring it inter the house. He finds the pile all fenced
off. But a stick he must have. Where the sliver
is, that&rsquo;s the only place he kin git through. Injun,
waitin&rsquo; on the ice, sees the sliver move, an&rsquo; knows
Mr. Beaver&rsquo;s gone in. He claps the stake down
agin, in place of the sliver. An&rsquo; then, of course,
there&rsquo;s nawthin&rsquo; left fer Mr. Beaver to do but
drown. He drowns jest at the place where he come
in an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t git out agin. That seems to knock
him out, like, an&rsquo; he jest gives up right there. Injun
fishes him out, dead, puts the sliver back, an&rsquo;
waits for another beaver. He don&rsquo;t have to wait
long&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; nine times outer ten he gits &rsquo;em all.
Ye see, they <i>must</i> git to the brush pile!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />Winter Under Water</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/F.png" title="" alt="F" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">FOR</span> three days more the Boy and Jabe
remained in the beaver country; and
every hour of the time, except when he
had to sleep, the Boy found full of interest. In
the daytime he compared the ponds and the dams
minutely, making measurements and diagrams. At
night he lay in hiding, beside a different pond each
night, and gained a rich store of knowledge of the
manners and customs of the little wilderness engineers.
On one pond&ndash;&ndash;his own, be it said&ndash;&ndash;he
made a rude raft of logs, and by its help visited
and inspected the houses on the island. The measurements
he obtained here made his note-book
pretty complete, as far as beaver life in summer
and fall was concerned.</p>
</div>
<p>Then Jabe finished his cruising, having covered
his territory. The packs were made up and slung;
the two campers set out on their three days&rsquo; tramp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
back to the settlements; and the solemn autumn
quiet descended once more upon the placid beaver
ponds, the shallow-running brooks, and the low-domed
Houses in the Water.</p>
<p>As the weather grew colder; and the earlier
frosts began to sheathe the surface of the pond
with clear, black ice, not melting out till noon; and
the bitten leaves, turning from red and gold to
brown, fell with ghostly whisperings through the
gray branches, the little beaver colony in Boy&rsquo;s
Pond grew feverishly active. Some subtle prescience
warned them that winter would close in early,
and that they must make haste to finish their storing
of supplies. The lengthening of their new canal
completed, their foraging grew easier. Trees fell
every night, and the brush pile reached a size that
guaranteed them immunity from hunger till spring.
By the time the dam had been strengthened to withstand
the late floods, there had been some sharp
snow-flurries, and the pond was half frozen over.
Then, in haste, the beavers brought up a quantity
of mud and grass roots, and plastered the domes
of their houses thickly till they no longer looked
like heaps of sticks, but rather resembled huge ant-hills.
No sooner was this task done than, as if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
beavers had been notified of its coming, the real
cold came. In one night the pond froze to a depth
of several inches; and over the roof of the House
in the Water was a casing of armour hard as stone.</p>
<p>The frost continued for several days, till the
stone-like roof was a good foot in thickness, as
was the ice over the surface of the pond. Then
a thick, feather-soft, windless snow-fall, lasting
twenty-four hours, served as a blanket against the
further piercing of the frost; and the beavers,
warm-housed, well-provisioned, and barricaded
against all their enemies but man, settled themselves
down to their long seclusion from the white, glittering,
bitter, outside world.</p>
<p>When the winter had tightened its grip, this outside
world was full of perils. Hungry lynxes,
foxes, and fishers (&ldquo;black cat,&rdquo; the woodsman
called them) hunted through the silent and pallid
aisles of the forest. They all would have loved
a meal of warm, fat beaver-meat; and they all
knew what these low, snow-covered mounds meant.
In the roof of each house the cunning builders had
left several tiny, crooked openings for ventilation,
and the warm air steaming up through these made
little chimney holes in the snow above. To these,
now and then, when stung by the hunger-pangs,
a lynx or fox would come, and sniff with greedy
longing at the appetizing aroma. Growing desperate,
the prowler would dig down, through perhaps
three feet of snow, till he reached the stony
roof of the house. On this he would tear and
scratch furiously, but in vain. Nothing less than
a pick-axe would break through that stony defence;
and the beavers, perhaps dimly aware of the futile
assault upon their walls, would go on calmly nibbling
birch-sticks in their safe, warm dark.</p>

&ldquo;HUNTED THROUGH THE SILENT AND PALLID AISLES OF THE FOREST.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>Inside the house everything was clean and dry.
All refuse from the clean repasts of the family was
scrupulously removed, and even the entrances, far
out in the pond, were kept free from litter. When
food was needed, a beaver would slip down into
the dark water of the tunnel, out into the glimmering
light of the pond, and straight to the brush pile.
Selecting a suitable stick, he would tow it back to
the house, up the main entrance, and into the dry,
dark chamber. When all the tender bark was eaten
off, the bare stick would be carried away and deposited
on the dam. It was an easy life; and the
beavers grew fat while all the rest of the wild kindreds,
save the porcupine and the bear, were growing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
lean with famine. There was absolutely nothing
to do but eat, sleep and take such exercise as
they would by swimming hither and thither at terrific
speed beneath the silver armour of the ice.</p>
<p>One night, however, there came to the pond an
enemy of whose powers they had never had experience.
Wandering down from northwestward,
under the impulse of one of those migratory whims
which sometimes give the lie to statistics and tradition,
came a sinister, dark, slow-moving beast
whose savage and crafty eyes took on a sudden
flame when they detected the white mound which
hid the shore beaver-house. The wolverene did
not need that faint, almost invisible wisp of vapour
from the air-holes to tell him there were beavers
below. He knew something about beavers. His
powerful forearms and mighty claws got him to
the bottom of the snow in a few seconds. Other
hungry marauders had done the same thing before,
to find themselves as far off as ever from their aim.
But the wolverene was not to be balked so easily.
His cunning nose found the minute openings of the
air-holes; and by digging his claws into these little
apertures he was able to put forth his great strength
and tear up some tiny fragments of frozen mud.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_15' id='linki_15'></a>

<p class='caption'>
&ldquo;A SINISTER, DARK, SLOW-MOVING BEAST.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>If he had had the patience to keep on at his strenuous
task unremittingly for, perhaps, twenty-four
hours or more, it is conceivable that this fierce digger
might have succeeded in making his way into
the chamber. There was no such implacable purpose,
however, in his attack. In a very little while
he would have desisted from what he knew to be
a vain undertaking. Even had he succeeded, the
beavers would have fled before he could reach them,
and taken refuge in their burrows under the bank.
But while he was still engrossed, perhaps only
amusing himself with the thought of giving the
dwellers in the house a bad quarter of an hour, it
chanced that a huge lynx came stealing along
through the shadows of the trees, which lay blue
and spectral in the white moonlight. He saw the
hind quarters of some unknown animal which was
busy working out a problem which he himself had
striven in vain to solve. The strange animal was
plainly smaller than himself. Moreover, he was in
a position to be taken at a disadvantage. Both
these points weighed with the lynx; and he was
enraged at this attempted poaching upon what he
chose to regard as his preserves. Creeping stealthily,
stealthily forward, eyes aflame and belly to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
snow, he sprang with a huge bound that landed
him, claws open, squarely on the wolverene&rsquo;s hind
quarters.</p>
<p>Instantly there arose a hideous screeching, growling,
spitting and snarling, which pierced even to
the ears of the beavers and sent them scurrying
wildly to their burrows in the bank. Under ordinary
circumstances the wolverene, with his dauntless
courage and tremendous strength, would have
given a good account of himself with any lynx
alive. But this time, caught with head down and
very busy, he stood small chance with his powerful
and lightning-swift assailant. In a very few minutes
the lynx&rsquo;s eviscerating claws had fairly torn
him to shreds; and thus came to a sudden close
the invasion of the wolverene.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, from far over the hills, moving
up from the lowlands by the sea, approached a
peril which the beavers did not dream of and could
find no ingenuity to evade. Two half-breed trappers,
semi-outlaws from the Northern Peninsula,
in search of fresh hunting-grounds, had come upon
this rich region of ponds and dams.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />The Saving of Boy&rsquo;s Pond</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/W.png" title="" alt="W" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_13'><span class="dcap">WHEN</span>, early in the winter, the lumbermen
moved into these woods which Jabe had
cruised over, establishing their camp
about two miles down-stream from the spot where
the Boy and the woodsman had had their lean-to,
Jabe came with them as boss of a gang. He had
for the time grown out of the mood for trapping.
Furs were low, and there was a &ldquo;sight&rdquo; more
money for him in lumbering that winter. Popular
with the rest of the lumbermen&ndash;&ndash;who most of
them knew of the Boy and his &ldquo;queer&rdquo; notions&ndash;&ndash;Jabe
had no difficulty in pledging them to respect
the sanctity of Boy&rsquo;s Pond and its inhabitants. In
fact, in the evenings around the red-hot stove, Jabe
told such interesting stories of what he and the
Boy had seen together a few months before, that
the reckless, big-hearted, boisterously profane but
sentimental woodsmen were more than half inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to declare the whole series of ponds under the special
protection of the camp. As for Boy&rsquo;s Pond,
that should be safe at any cost.</p>
</div>
<p>Not long after Christmas the Boy, taking advantage
of the fact that some fresh supplies were being
sent out from the Settlement by team, came to visit
the camp. The head of the big lumber company
which owned these woods was a friend of the Boy&rsquo;s
father, and the Boy himself was welcome in any of
the camps. His special purpose in coming now
was to see how his beavers got on in winter, and
to assure himself that Jabe had been able to protect
them.</p>
<p>The morning after his arrival in camp he set
out to visit the pond. He went on snowshoes, of
course, and carried his little Winchester as he always
did in the woods, holding tenaciously that the
true lover of peace should be ever prepared for
war. The lumbermen had gone off to work with
the first of dawn; and far away to his right he
heard the axes ringing, faintly but crisply, on the
biting morning air. For half a mile he followed
a solitary snowshoe trail, which he knew to be
Jabe&rsquo;s by the peculiar broad toe and long, trailing
heel which Jabe affected in snowshoes; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
wondered what his friend was doing in this direction,
so far from the rest of the choppers. Then
Jabe&rsquo;s track swerved off to the left, crossing the
brook; and the Boy tramped on over the unbroken
snow.</p>
<p>The sound of the distant choppers soon died
away, and he was alone in the unearthly silence.
The sun, not yet risen quite clear of the hilltops,
sent spectral, level, far-reaching gleams of thin
pink-and-saffron light down the alleys of the
sheeted trees. The low crunching of his snowshoes
on the crisp snow sounded almost blatant in
the Boy&rsquo;s tensely listening ears. In spite of himself
he began to tread stealthily, as if the sound
of his steps might bring some ghostly enemy upon
him from out of the whiteness.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of an axe came faintly to
his ears from straight ahead, where he knew no
choppers were at work. He stopped short. That
axe was not striking wood. It was striking ice. It
was chopping the ice of Boy&rsquo;s Pond! What could
it mean? There were no fish in that pond to chop
the ice for!</p>
<p>As he realized that some one was preparing to
trap his beavers his face flushed with anger, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
he started forward at a run. That it was no one
from the camp he knew very well. It must be some
strange trapper who did not know that this pond
was under protection. He thought this out as he
ran on; and his anger calmed down. Trappers were
a decent, understanding folk; and a word of explanation
would make things all right. There were
plenty of other beaver ponds in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Pressing through the white-draped ranks of the
young fir-trees, he came out suddenly upon the edge
of the pond, and halted an instant in irresolution.
Two dark-visaged men&ndash;&ndash;his quick eye knew them
for half-breeds&ndash;&ndash;were busy on the snow about
twenty paces above the low mound which marked
the main beaver house. They had a number of
stakes with them; and they were cutting a series
of holes in a circle. From what Jabe had told him
of the Indian methods, he saw at once that these
were not regular trappers, but poachers, who were
violating the game laws and planning to annihilate
the whole beaver colony by fencing in its brush
pile.</p>
<p>The Boy realized now that the situation was a
delicate if not a dangerous one. For an instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
he thought of going back to camp for help; but
one of the men was on his knees, fixing the stakes,
and the other was already chopping what appeared
to be the last hole. Delay might mean the death
of several of his precious beavers. Indignation
and compassion together urged him on, and his
young face hardened in unaccustomed lines.</p>
<p>Walking out upon the snow a little way, he
halted, at a distance of perhaps thirty paces from
the poachers. At the sound of his snowshoes the
two men looked up scowling and apprehensive; and
the kneeling one sprang to his feet. They wanted
no witnesses of their illegal work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the Boy politely.</p>
<p>At the sound of his soft young voice, the sight
of his slender figure and youthful face, their apprehensions
vanished; but not their anger at being
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo; growled one, in a surly voice; while
the other never opened his mouth. Then they
looked at each other with meaning question in their
eyes. How were they going to keep this unwelcome
visitor from betraying them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you,&rdquo; said the Boy sweetly,
&ldquo;to be so kind as to stop trapping on this pond.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Of course you didn&rsquo;t know it, but this is my pond,
and there is no trapping allowed on it. It is reserved,
you know; and I don&rsquo;t want a single one
of my beavers killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the axe scowled fiercely and said
nothing. But the other, the one who had been
driving the stakes, laughed in harsh derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, hey, sonny?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Well,
you just wait an&rsquo; watch us. We&rsquo;ll show ye whose
beaver they be!&rdquo; And turning his back in scorn
of his interlocutor&rsquo;s youth, he knelt down again to
drive another stake. The man who had not spoken,
however, stood leaning on his axe, eying the Boy
with an ugly expression of menace.</p>
<p>The Boy&rsquo;s usually quiet blood was now pounding
and tingling with anger. His alert eyes had measured
the whole situation, and noted that the men
had no firearms but their rifles, which were leaning
against a tree on the shore fully fifty yards behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, with so confident a tone of
authority that the kneeling man looked up, though
with a sneer on his face. &ldquo;Unless you go away
from this pond at once, I&rsquo;ll get the men from the
camp, and they&rsquo;ll make you go. They&rsquo;ll not be so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
polite as I am. You&rsquo;re just poachers, anyway.
And the boys will like as not just run you clean out
of the country. Will you do as I ask you, or shall
I go and get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the axe spat out some French
curse which the Boy didn&rsquo;t understand very clearly.
But the man at the stakes jumped up again with a
dangerous grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right where you are, sonny, till
we&rsquo;re done with you,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You understand?
You&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; to git hurt ef ye gits in our
way any! See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boy was now in a white rage; but he kept
his wits cool and his eyes watchful. He realized
at this moment that he was in great danger; but,
his mettle being sound, this only made him the more
resolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You&rsquo;ve decided!&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what the boys will have to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he made a movement as if to turn,
but without taking his eyes from the enemy. The
movement just served to swing his little Winchester
into a readier position.</p>
<p>At his first move the man with the axe took a
step forward, and swung up his axe with a peculiar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
gesture which the Boy understood. He had seen
the woodsmen throw their axes. He knew well
their quickness and their deadly precision. But
quickness and precision with the little Winchester
were his own especial pride,&ndash;&ndash;and, after all, he
had not turned any further than was just right for
a good shot. Even as the axe was on the verge of
leaving the poacher&rsquo;s hand, the rifle cracked sharply.
The poacher yelled a curse, and his arm dropped.
The axe flew wide, landing nowhere near its aim.
On the instant both the half-breeds turned, and
raced for their rifles on the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, or I&rsquo;ll shoot you both!&rdquo; shouted the Boy,
now with embarrassment added to his wrath. In
their wild fury at being so balked by a boy, both
men trusted to his missing his aim&ndash;&ndash;or to the hope
that his gun was not a repeater. They ignored his
command, and rushed on. The Boy was just going
to shoot again, aiming at their legs; when, to his
amazement and inconceivable relief, out from behind
the tree where the poachers&rsquo; rifles leaned, came
Jabe.</p>
<p>Snatching up one of the guns, he echoed the
Boy&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop <i>right</i> there!&rdquo; he ordered curtly. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
up with your hands, too! Mebbe youse kin fling
a knife slick ez ye kin an axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breeds stood like stones. One held up
both hands; but the other only held up his left,
his right being helpless. They knew there was nothing
to say. They were fairly caught. They were
poaching. The tall lumberman had seen the axe
flung. Their case was a black one; and any attempt
to explain could do no less than make it worse.
They did not even dare to look at each other, but
kept their narrow, beady eyes fixed on Jabe&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The Boy came swiftly to Jabe&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neat shot!&rdquo; said the woodsman; but the note
of astonished admiration in his tone was the most
thrilling compliment the Boy had ever received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with them, Jabe?&rdquo;
he inquired, mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fer you to say! They&rsquo;re yourn!&rdquo; answered
Jabe, keeping his eyes on the prisoners.</p>
<p>The Boy looked the two culprits over carefully,
with his calm, boyish gaze. He was overwhelmingly
elated, but would have died rather than show
it. His air was that of one who is quite used to
capturing two outlaws,&ndash;&ndash;and having axes hurled
at his head,&ndash;&ndash;and putting bullets through men&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
shoulders. He could not help feeling sorry for the
man with the bullet through his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jabe,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t let
them go with their guns, because they&rsquo;re such
sneaking brutes, they&rsquo;d shoot us from behind a tree.
And we can&rsquo;t let them go without their guns, because
we can&rsquo;t be sure they wouldn&rsquo;t starve before
they got to their own homes. And we don&rsquo;t want
to take them into camp, for the fellows would probably
treat them as they deserve,&ndash;&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t want
them to get anything so bad as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it <i>might</i> be better not to let the hands
git hold of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; agreed Jabe. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be
rough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleam of hope came into the prisoners&rsquo; eyes.
The unwounded one spoke. And he had the perspicacity
to address himself to the Boy rather than
to Jabe, thereby conciliating the Boy appreciably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo; he petitioned, choking down his
rage. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll swear to quit, right now an&rsquo; fer
good; an&rsquo; not to try to git back at yez!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to leave yer guns!&rdquo; said Jabe
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the only guns we got; an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re our
livin&rsquo;, fer the winter!&rdquo; protested the half-breed,
still looking at the Boy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If we take away their guns, what&rsquo;s the good of
making them swear?&rdquo; demanded the Boy, stepping
up and gazing into their eyes. &ldquo;No, I reckon if
they give their oath, they&rsquo;ll stick to it. Where&rsquo;s
your camp, men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yonder, about three mile!&rdquo; answered the
spokesman, nodding toward the northeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we give you back your guns,&rdquo; went on the
Boy gently, &ldquo;will you both give us your oath to
clear right out of this country altogether, and not
trap at all this side of the line? And will you take
oath, also, that you will never, in any way, try to
get even with either him or me for having downed
you this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartain!&rdquo; responded the spokesman, with obvious
sincerity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to all that! An&rsquo; I
won&rsquo;t never <i>want</i> to git even, if you use us so gentlemanlike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you swear, too?&rdquo; inquired the Boy,
turning to the silent one who had thrown the axe
at him. The fellow glared at him defiantly for a
moment, then glanced at his wounded arm, which
hung limp at his side. At last he answered with a
sullen growl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll swear! Got to! Curse you!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Boy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best way
for all of us. Jabe, will you take their oaths. You
know how better than I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; responded the latter, shrugging
his shoulders in a way which said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s your
idee, not mine!&rdquo; Then he proceeded to bind each
man separately by an oath which left no loophole,
and which was sealed by all that their souls held
sacred. This done, he handed back the rifles,&ndash;&ndash;and
the two poachers, without a word, turned their
backs and made off at a swift lope straight up the
open pond. The Boy and Jabe watched them till
they vanished among the trees. Then, with a shy
little laugh, the Boy picked up the axe which had
been hurled at his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he left me this,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;to
kind of remember him by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sneakin&rsquo; skunk!&rdquo; growled Jabe. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d
had my way, it&rsquo;d be the penitentiary for the both
of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening, when the whole story was told,
the woodsmen were indignant, for a time, because
the half-breeds had been let go; but at last they
gave heed to Jabe&rsquo;s representations, and acknowledged
that the Boy&rsquo;s plan had saved a &ldquo;sight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
bother.&rdquo; To guard against future difficulties, however,
they took a big piece of smooth board, and
painted the following sign, to be nailed up on a
conspicuous tree beside the pond.</p>
<p class='tp' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:10px;'>NOTICE</p>
<p class='tp' style='margin-bottom:1em;font-size:smaller;'>THIS IS BOY&rsquo;S POND. NO TRAPPING HERE.<br />IF ANYBODY WANTS TO SAY, WHY NOT? LAWLER&rsquo;S<br />CAMP WILL LET HIM KNOW.</p>

<h2>The White-slashed Bull</h2>
</div>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/H.png" title="" alt="H" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">HER</span> back crushed beneath the massive
weight of a &ldquo;deadfall,&rdquo; the mother
moose lay slowly sobbing her life out on
the sweet spring air. The villainous log, weighted
cunningly with rocks, had caught her just above
the withers, bearing her forward so that her forelegs
were doubled under her, and her neck outstretched
so that she could not lift her muzzle from
the wet moss. Though her eyes were already glazing,
and her nostrils full of a blown and blood-streaked
froth, from time to time she would struggle
desperately to raise her head, for she yearned
to lick the sprawling, wobbling legs of the ungainly
calf which stood close beside her, bewildered because
she would not rise and suckle him.</p>
</div>
<p>The dying animal lay in the middle of the trail,
which was an old, half-obliterated logger&rsquo;s road,
running straight east into the glow of the spring
sunrise. The young birches and poplars, filmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
with the first of the green, crowded close upon the
trail, with, here and there, a rose-blooming maple,
here and there, a sombre, black-green hemlock,
towering over the thick second growth. The early
air was fresh, but soft; fragrant with the breath
of opening buds. Faint mists streamed up into the
sunlight along the mossy line of the trail, and the
only sounds breaking the silence of the wilderness
were the sweetly plaintive calls of two rain-birds,
answering each other slowly over the treetops.
Everything in the scene&ndash;&ndash;the tenderness of the
colour and the air, the responses of the mating
birds, the hope and the expectancy of all the waking
world&ndash;&ndash;seemed piteously at variance with the
anguish of the stricken mother and her young,
down there in the solitude of the trail.</p>
<p>Presently, in the undergrowth beside the trail,
a few paces beyond the deadfall, a twig snapped
sharply. Admonished by that experience of a thousand
ancestral generations which is instinct, the
calf lifted his big awkward ears apprehensively,
and with a shiver drew closer to his mother&rsquo;s
crushed body. A moment later a gaunt black bear
thrust his head and shoulders forth from the undergrowth,
and surveyed the scene with savage, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
shrewd, little eyes. He was hungry, and to his
palate no other delicacy the spring wilderness could
ever afford was equal to a young moose calf. But
the situation gave him pause. The mother moose
was evidently in a trap; and the bear was wary
of all traps. He sank back into the undergrowth,
and crept noiselessly nearer to reconnoitre. In his
suspicious eyes even a calf might be dangerous
to tamper with, under such unusual conditions as
these. As he vanished the calf shuddered violently,
and tried to climb upon his mother&rsquo;s mangled body.</p>
<p>In a few seconds the bear&rsquo;s head appeared again,
close by the base of the deadfall. With crafty
nose he sniffed at the great timber which held the
moose cow down. The calf was now almost within
reach of the deadly sweep of his paw; but the man-smell
was strong on the deadfall, and the bear was
still suspicious. While he hesitated, from behind
a bend in the trail came a sound of footsteps. The
bear knew the sound. A man was coming. Yes,
certainly there was some trick about it. With a
grunt of indignant disgust he shrank back again
into the thicket and fled stealthily from so dangerous
a neighbourhood. Hungry as he was, he
had no wish to try conclusions with man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>The woodsman came striding down the trail hurriedly,
rounded the turn, and stopped abruptly. He
understood at a glance the evil work of the game
poachers. With indignant pity, he stepped forward
and drew a merciful knife across the throat of the
suffering beast. The calf shrank away and stood
staring at him anxiously, wavering between terror
and trust.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the man hesitated. Of one
thing he was certain: the poachers who had set the
deadfall must not profit by their success. Moreover,
fresh moose-meat would not be unappreciated
in his backwoods cabin. He turned and retraced
his steps at a run, fearing lest some hungry spring
marauders should arrive in his absence. And the
calf, more than ever terrified by his mother&rsquo;s unresponsiveness,
stared after him uneasily as he vanished.</p>
<p>For half an hour nothing happened. The early
chill passed from the air, a comforting warmth
glowed down the trail, the two rain-birds kept
whistling to each other their long, persuasive, melancholy
call, and the calf stood motionless, waiting,
with the patience of the wild, for he knew not what.
Then there came a clanking of chains, a trampling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
of heavy feet, and around the turn appeared the
man again, with a pair of big brown horses harnessed
to a drag-sled. The calf backed away as the
man approached, and watched with dull wonder
as the great log was rolled aside and his mother&rsquo;s
limp, crushed form was hoisted laboriously upon
the sled. This accomplished, the man turned and
came to him gently, with hand outstretched. To
run away would have been to run away from the
shelter of his mother&rsquo;s presence; so, with a snort
of apprehension, he submitted to being stroked and
rubbed about the ears and neck and throat. The
sensation was curiously comforting, and suddenly
his fear vanished. With his long, mobile muzzle he
began to tug appealingly at a convenient fold of
the man&rsquo;s woollen sleeve. Smiling complacently
at this sign of confidence, the man left him, and
started the team at a slow walk up the trail. With
a hoarse bleat of alarm, thinking he was about to
be deserted, the calf followed after the sled, his
long legs wobbling awkwardly.</p>
<p>From the first moment that she set eyes upon
him, shambling awkwardly into the yard at her husband&rsquo;s
heels, Jabe Smith&rsquo;s wife was inhospitable
toward the ungainly youngling of the wild. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
declared that he would take all the milk. And he
did. For the next two months she was unable to
make any butter, and her opinions on the subject
were expressed without reserve. But Jabe was inflexible,
in his taciturn, backwoods way, and the
calf, till he was old enough to pasture, got all the
milk he wanted. He grew and throve so astonishingly
that Jabe began to wonder if there was not
some mistake in the scheme of things, making cows&rsquo;
milk the proper nutriment for moose calves. By
autumn the youngster was so big and sleek that he
might almost have passed for a yearling.</p>
<p>Jabe Smith, lumberman, pioneer and guide, loved
all animals, even those which in the fierce joy of the
hunt he loved to kill. The young moose bull, however,
was his peculiar favourite&ndash;&ndash;partly, perhaps,
because of Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s relentless hostility to it.
And the ungainly youngster repaid his love with
a devotion that promised to become embarrassing.
All around the farm he was for ever at his heels,
like a dog; and if, by any chance, he became separated
from his idol, he would make for him in
a straight line, regardless of currant bushes, bean
rows, cabbage patches or clothes-lines. This strenuous
directness did not further endear him to Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
Smith. That good lady used to lie awake at night,
angrily devising schemes for getting rid of the
&ldquo;ugly brute.&rdquo; These schemes of vengeance were
such a safety-valve to her injured feelings that she
would at last make up her mind to content herself
with &ldquo;takin&rsquo; it out on the hide o&rsquo; the critter&rdquo; next
day, with a sound hickory stick. When next day
came, however, and she went out to milk, the
youngster would shamble up to greet her with such
amiable trust in his eyes that her wrath would be,
for the moment, disarmed, and her fell purpose
would fritter out in a futile &ldquo;Scat, you brute!&rdquo;
Then she would condone her weakness by thinking
of what she would do to the animal &ldquo;some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &ldquo;some day,&rdquo; as luck would have it, came
rather sooner than she expected. From the first,
the little moose had evinced a determination to take
up his abode in the kitchen, in his dread of being
separated from Jabe. Being a just man, Jabe had
conceded at once that his wife should have the
choosing of her kitchen guests; and, to avoid complications,
he had rigged up a hinged bar across
the kitchen doorway, so that the door could safely
stand open. When the little bull was not at Jabe&rsquo;s
heels, and did not know where to find him, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
favourite attitude was standing in front of the
kitchen door, his long nose thrust in as far as the
bar would permit, his long ears waving hopefully,
his eyes intently on the mysterious operations of
Mrs. Jabe&rsquo;s housework. Though she would not
have acknowledged it for worlds, even to her inmost
heart, the good woman took much satisfaction
out of that awkward, patient presence in the doorway.
When things went wrong with her, in that
perverse way so trying to the careful housewife,
she could ease her feelings wonderfully by expressing
them without reserve to the young moose, who
never looked amused or attempted to answer back.</p>
<p>But one day, as it chanced, her feelings claimed
a more violent easement&ndash;&ndash;and got it. She was
scrubbing the kitchen floor. Just in the doorway
stood the scrubbing-pail, full of dirty suds. On
a chair close by stood a dish of eggs. The moose
calf was nowhere in sight, and the bar was down.
Tired and hot, she got up from her aching knees
and went over to the stove to see if the pot was
boiling, ready to make fresh suds.</p>
<p>At this moment the young bull, who had been
searching in vain all over the farm for Jabe, came
up to the door with a silent, shambling rush. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
bar was down. Surely, then, Jabe was inside!
Overjoyed at the opportunity he lurched his long
legs over the threshold. Instantly his great, loose
hoofs slid on the slippery floor, and he came down
sprawling, striking the pail of dirty suds as he
fell. With a seething souse the slops went abroad,
all over the floor. At the same time the bouncing
pail struck the chair, turned it over, and sent the
dish of eggs crashing in every direction.</p>
<p>For one second Mrs. Jabe stared rigidly at the
mess of eggs, suds and broken china, at the startled
calf struggling to his feet. Then, with a hysterical
scream, she turned, snatched the boiling pot from
the stove, and hurled it blindly at the author of all
mischief.</p>
<p>Happily for the blunderer, Mrs. Jabe&rsquo;s rage was
so unbridled that she really tried to hit the object
of it. Therefore, she missed. The pot went crashing
through the leg of a table and shivered to atoms
against the log wall, contributing its full share to
the discouraging mess on the floor. But, as it
whirled past, a great wedge of the boiling water
leaped out over the rim, flew off at a tangent, and
caught the floundering calf full in the side, in a
long flare down from the tip of the left shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
The scalding fluid seemed to cling in the short, fine
hair almost like an oil. With a loud bleat of pain
the calf shot to his feet and went galloping around
the yard. Mrs. Jabe rushed to the door, and stared
at him wide-eyed. In a moment her senses came
back to her, and she realized what a hideous thing
she had done. Next she remembered Jabe&ndash;&ndash;and
what he would think of it!</p>
<p>Then, indeed, her conscience awoke in earnest,
and a wholesome dread enlivened her remorse.
Forgetting altogether the state of her kitchen, she
rushed through the slop to the flour-barrel. Flour,
she had always heard, was the thing for burns and
scalds. The pesky calf should be treated right, if
it took the whole barrel. Scooping up an extravagant
dishpanful of the white, powdery stuff, and
recklessly spilling a lot of it to add to the mixture
on the floor, she rushed out into the yard to apply
her treatment, and, if possible, poultice her conscience.</p>
<p>The young moose, anguished and bewildered,
had at last taken refuge in the darkest corner of
the stable. As Mrs. Jabe approached with her pan
of flour, he stood staring and shaking, but made
no effort to avoid her, which touched the over-impetuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
dame to a fresh pang of penitence. She
did not know that the stupid youngster had quite
failed to associate her in any way with his suffering.
It was only the pot&ndash;&ndash;the big, black thing
which had so inexplicably come bounding at him&ndash;&ndash;that
he blamed. From Mrs. Jabe&rsquo;s hands he expected
some kind of consolation.</p>
<p>In the gloom of the stall Mrs. Jabe could not see
the extent of the calf&rsquo;s injury. &ldquo;Mebbe the water
wasn&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> bilin&rsquo;!&rdquo; she murmured hopefully,
coaxing and dragging the youngster forth into the
light. The hope, however, proved vain as brief.
In a long streak down behind the shoulder the hair
was already slipping off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarved ye right!&rdquo; she grumbled remorsefully,
as with gentle fingers she began sifting the flour
up and down over the wound. The light stuff
seemed to soothe the anguish for the moment, and
the sufferer stood quite still till the scald was thoroughly
covered with a tenacious white cake. Then
a fresh and fiercer pang seized the wound. With
a bleat he tore himself away, and rushed off, tail
in air, across the stump-pasture and into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he won&rsquo;t come back, and then Jabe
won&rsquo;t never need to know!&rdquo; soliloquized Mrs.
Jabe, returning to clean up her kitchen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>The sufferer returned, however, early in the
afternoon, and was in his customary attitude before
the door when Jabe, a little later, came back also.
The long white slash down his favourite&rsquo;s side
caught the woodsman&rsquo;s eye at once. He looked
at it critically, touched the flour with tentative finger-tips,
then turned on his wife a look of poignant
interrogation. But Mrs. Jabe was ready for him.
Her nerve had recovered. The fact that her victim
showed no fear of her had gradually reassured her.
What Jabe didn&rsquo;t know would never hurt him, she
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yer pesky brat come stumblin&rsquo; into the
kitchen when the bar was down, a-lookin&rsquo; for ye.
An&rsquo; he upset the bilin&rsquo; water I was goin&rsquo; to scrub
with, an&rsquo; broke the pot. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got to have a new
pot right off, Jabe Smith&ndash;&ndash;mind that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scalded himself pretty bad!&rdquo; remarked Jabe.
&ldquo;Poor little beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done the best <i>I</i> know&rsquo;d how fer him!&rdquo; said
his wife with an injured air. &ldquo;Wasted most a
quart o&rsquo; good flour on his worthless hide! Wish&rsquo;t
he&rsquo;d broke his neck &rsquo;stead of the only pot I got
that&rsquo;s big enough to bile the pig&rsquo;s feed in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you done jest about right, I reckon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Mandy,&rdquo; replied Jabe, ashamed of his suspicions.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in to the Cross Roads an&rsquo; git ye a new pot
to-morrer, an&rsquo; some tar for the scald. The tar&rsquo;ll
be better&rsquo;n flour, an&rsquo; keep the flies off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose some men <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> got nothin&rsquo; better to
do than be doctorin&rsquo; up a fool moose calf!&rdquo; assented
Mrs. Jabe promptly, with a snort of censorious
resignation.</p>
<p>Whether because the flour and the tar had virtues,
or because the clean flesh of the wild kindreds
makes all haste to purge itself of ills, it was not
long before the scald was perfectly healed. But the
reminder of it remained ineffaceable&ndash;&ndash;a long,
white slash down across the brown hide of the
young bull, from the tip of the left fore shoulder.</p>
<p>Throughout the winter the young moose contentedly
occupied the cow-stable, with the two cows
and the yoke of red oxen. He throve on the fare
Jabe provided for him&ndash;&ndash;good meadow hay with
armfuls of &ldquo;browse&rdquo; cut from the birch, poplar
and cherry thickets. Jabe trained him to haul a
pung, finding him slower to learn than a horse,
but making up for his dulness by his docility. He
had to be driven with a snaffle, refusing absolutely
to admit a bit between his teeth; and, with the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
good-will in the world, he could never be taught
to allow for the pung or sled to which he was harnessed.
If left alone for a moment he would walk
over fences with it, or through the most tangled
thickets, if thereby seemed the most direct way to
reach Jabe; and once, when Jabe, vaingloriously
and at great speed, drove him in to the Cross
Roads, he smashed the vehicle to kindling-wood in
the amiable determination to follow his master into
the Cross Roads store. On this occasion also he
made himself respected, but unpopular, by killing,
with one lightning stroke of a great fore hoof, a
huge mongrel mastiff belonging to the storekeeper.
The mastiff had sprung out at him wantonly, resenting
his peculiar appearance. But the storekeeper
had been so aggrieved that Jabe had felt
constrained to mollify him with a five-dollar bill.
He decided, therefore, that his favourite&rsquo;s value
was as a luxury, rather than a utility; and the
young bull was put no more to the practices of a
horse. Jabe had driven a bull moose in harness,
and all the settlement could swear to it. The glory
was all his.</p>
<p>By early summer the young bull was a tremendous,
long-legged, high-shouldered beast, so big,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
so awkward, so friendly, and so sure of everybody&rsquo;s
good-will that everybody but Jabe was terribly
afraid of him. He had no conception of the purposes
of a fence; and he could not be taught that
a garden was not meant for him to lie down in.
As the summer advanced, and the young bull&rsquo;s
stature with it, Jabe Smith began to realize that
his favourite was an expensive and sometimes embarrassing
luxury. Nevertheless, when September
brought budding spikes of horns and a strange new
restlessness to the stalwart youngster, and the first
full moon of October lured him one night away
from the farm on a quest which he could but blindly
follow, Jabe was inconsolable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t no more&rsquo;n a calf yet, big as he is!&rdquo;
fretted Jabe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be gittin&rsquo; himself shot, the
fool. Or mebbe some old bull&rsquo;ll be after givin&rsquo; him
a lickin&rsquo; fer interferin&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;ll come home to
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which his wife retorted with calm superiority:
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a bigger fool&rsquo;n even I took ye fer, Jabe
Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young bull did not come back that winter,
nor the following summer, nor the next year,
nor the next. Neither did any Indian or hunter or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
lumberman have anything to report as to a bull
moose of great stature, with a long white slash
down his side. Either his quest had carried him
far to other and alien ranges, or some fatal mischance
of the wild had overtaken his inexperience.
The latter was Jabe&rsquo;s belief, and he concluded that
his ungainly favourite had too soon taken the long
trail for the Red Men&rsquo;s land of ghosts.</p>
<p>Though Jabe Smith was primarily a lumberman
and backwoods farmer, he was also a hunter&rsquo;s
guide, so expert that his services in this direction
were not to be obtained without very special inducement.
At &ldquo;calling&rdquo; moose he was acknowledged
to have no rival. When he laid his grimly-humourous
lips to the long tube of birch-bark, which is the
&ldquo;caller&rsquo;s&rdquo; instrument of illusion, there would
come from it a strange sound, great and grotesque,
harsh yet appealing, rude yet subtle, and mysterious
as if the uncomprehended wilderness had itself
found voice. Old hunters, wise in all woodcraft,
had been deceived by the sound&ndash;&ndash;and much more
easily the impetuous bull, waiting, high-antlered
and eager, for the love-call of his mate to summon
him down the shore of the still and moon-tranced
lake.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>When a certain Famous Hunter, whose heart
took pride in horns and heads and hides&ndash;&ndash;the
trophies won by his unerring rifle in all four corners
of earth&ndash;&ndash;found his way at last to the tumbled
wilderness that lies about the headwaters of the
Quah Davic, it was naturally one of the great New
Brunswick moose that he was after. Nothing but
the noblest antlers that New Brunswick forests
bred could seem to him worthy of a place on those
walls of his, whence the surly front of a musk-ox
of the Barren Grounds glared stolid defiance to the
snarl of an Orinoco jaguar, and the black, colossal
head of a Kadiak bear was eyed derisively by the
monstrous and malignant mask of a two-horned
rhinoceros. With such a quest upon him, the Famous
Hunter came, and naturally sought the guidance
of Jabe Smith, whom he lured from the tamer
distractions of a &ldquo;timber cruise&rdquo; by double pay
and the pledge of an extravagant bonus if the quest
should be successful.</p>
<p>The lake, lying low between its wooded hills,
was like a glimmering mirror in the misty October
twilight when Jabe and the Famous Hunter crept
stealthily down to it. In a dense covert beside the
water&rsquo;s edge they hid themselves. Beside them
stretched the open ribbon of a narrow water-meadow,
through which a slim brook, tinkling
faintly over its pebbles, slipped out into the stillness.
Just beyond the mouth of the brook a low,
bare spit of sand jutted forth darkly upon the pale
surface of the lake.</p>

&ldquo;IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MOON APPEARED ... THAT JABE BEGAN TO CALL.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>It was not until the moon appeared&ndash;&ndash;a red, ominous
segment of a disk&ndash;&ndash;over the black and
rugged ridge of the hills across the lake, that Jabe
began to call. Three times he set the hollow birch-bark
to his mouth, and sent the hoarse, appealing
summons echoing over the water. And the man,
crouching invisible in the thick shadow beside him,
felt a thrill in his nerves, a prickling in his cheeks,
at that mysterious cry, which seemed to him to have
something almost of menace in its lure. Even so,
he thought, might Pan have summoned his followers,
shaggy and dangerous, yet half divine, to
some symbolic revel.</p>
<p>The call evoked no answer of any kind. Jabe
waited till the moon, still red and distorted, had
risen almost clear of the ridge. Then he called
again, and yet again, and again waited. From
straight across the strangely-shadowed water came
a sudden sharp crashing of underbrush, as if some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
one had fallen to beating the bushes furiously with
sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; whispered Jabe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a
big one, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not yet out of his mouth when
there arose a most startling commotion in the
thicket close behind them, and both men swung
around like lightning, jerking up their rifles. At
the same instant came an elusive whiff of pungency
on the chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! only a bear!&rdquo; muttered Jabe, as the
commotion retreated in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was close upon us!&rdquo; remarked the visitor.
&ldquo;I could have poked him with my gun! Had
he any special business with us, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took me for a cow moose, an&rsquo; was jest a-goin&rsquo;
to swipe me!&rdquo; answered Jabe, rather elated at the
compliment which the bear had paid to his counterfeit.</p>
<p>The Famous Hunter drew a breath of profound
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;if your amiable
New Brunswick backwoods can&rsquo;t get up a thrill
quite worthy of the African jungle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St!&rdquo; admonished Jabe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;. An&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
mad, too! Thinks that racket was another bull,
gittin&rsquo; ahead of &rsquo;im. Don&rsquo;t ye <i>breathe</i> now, no
more!&rdquo; And raising the long bark, he called
through it again, this time more softly, more enticingly,
but always with that indescribable wildness,
shyness and roughness rasping strangely
through the note. The hurried approach of the
bull could be followed clearly around the head of
the lake. It stopped, and Jabe called again. In a
minute or two there came a brief, explosive, grunting
reply&ndash;&ndash;this time from a point much nearer.
The great bull had stopped his crashing progress
and was slipping his vast, impetuous bulk through
the underbrush as noiselessly as a weasel. The
stillness was so perfect after that one echoing response
that the Famous Hunter turned a look of interrogation
upon Jabe&rsquo;s shadowy face. The latter
breathed almost inaudibly: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s
nigh here!&rdquo; And the hunter clutched his rifle with
that fine, final thrill of unparalleled anticipation.</p>
<p>The moon was now well up, clear of the treetops
and the discolouring mists, hanging round and
honey-yellow over the hump of the ridge. The
magic of the night deepened swiftly. The sandspit
and the little water-meadow stood forth unshadowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
in the spectral glare. Far out in the shine of
the lake a fish jumped, splashing sharply. Then a
twig snapped in the dense growth beyond the
water-meadow. Jabe furtively lifted the bark, and
mumbled in it caressingly. The next moment&ndash;&ndash;so
suddenly and silently that it seemed as if he had
taken instant shape in the moonlight&ndash;&ndash;appeared
a gigantic moose, standing in the meadow, his head
held high, his nostrils sniffing arrogant inquiry.
The broadly-palmated antlers crowning his mighty
head were of a spread and symmetry such as Jabe
had never even imagined.</p>
<p>Almost imperceptibly the Hunter raised his rifle&ndash;&ndash;a
slender shadow moving in paler shadows.
The great bull, gazing about expectantly for the
mate who had called, stood superb and indomitable,
ghost-gray in the moonlight, a mark no tyro could
miss. A cherry branch intervened, obscuring the
foresight of the Hunter&rsquo;s rifle. The Hunter shifted
his position furtively. His crooked finger was just
about to tighten on the trigger. At this moment,
when the very night hung stiller as if with a sense
of crisis, the giant bull turned, exposing his left
flank to the full glare of the moonlight. Something
gleamed silver down his side, as if it were a shining
belt thrown across his shoulder.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>With a sort of hiss from between his teeth Jabe
shot out his long arm and knocked up the barrel
of the rifle. In the same instant the Hunter&rsquo;s finger
had closed on the trigger. The report rang out,
shattering the night; the bullet whined away high
over the treetops, and the great bull, springing at
one bound far back into the thickets, vanished like
an hallucination.</p>
<p>Jabe stood forth into the open, his gaunt face
working with suppressed excitement. The Hunter
followed, speechless for a moment between amazement,
wrath and disappointment. At last he found
voice, and quite forgot his wonted courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&ndash;&ndash;n you!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;What do you
mean by that? What in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jabe, suddenly calm, turned and eyed him
with a steadying gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit all that, now!&rdquo; he retorted crisply. &ldquo;I
knowed <i>jest</i> what I was doin&rsquo;! I knowed that bull
when he were a leetle, awkward staggerer. I brung
him up on a bottle; an&rsquo; I loved him. He skun out
four years ago. I&rsquo;d most ruther &rsquo;ave seen <i>you</i> shot
than that ther&rsquo; bull, I tell ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Famous Hunter looked sour; but he was beginning
to understand the situation, and his anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
died down. As he considered, Jabe, too, began to
see the other side of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right sorry to disapp&rsquo;int ye so!&rdquo; he went
on apologetically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hev to call off this deal
atween you an&rsquo; me, I reckon. An&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to be no more shooting over <i>this</i> range, if I kin
help it&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; I guess I kin!&ndash;&ndash;till I kin git that
ther&rsquo; white-slashed bull drove away back over on to
the Upsalquitch, where the hunters won&rsquo;t fall foul
of him! But I&rsquo;ll git ye another guide, jest as good
as me, or better, what ain&rsquo;t got no particular friends
runnin&rsquo; loose in the woods to bother &rsquo;im. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
send ye &rsquo;way down on to the Sevogle, where ther&rsquo;s
as big heads to be shot as ever have been. I can&rsquo;t
do more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can!&rdquo; declared the Famous Hunter,
who had quite recovered his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Jabe doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pardon me for losing my temper and
swearing at you!&rdquo; answered the Famous Hunter,
holding out his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t knock
over your magnificent friend. It&rsquo;s good for the
breed that he got off. But you&rsquo;ll have to find me
something peculiarly special now, down on that
Sevogle.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>When the Blueberries Are Ripe</h2>
</div>
<div class="drop">

<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">THE</span> steep, rounded, rock-scarred face of
Bald Mountain, for all its naked grimness,
looked very cheerful in the last of
the warm-coloured sunset. There were no trees;
but every little hollow, every tiny plateau, every bit
of slope that was not too steep for clinging roots to
find hold, was clothed with a mat of blueberry
bushes. The berries, of an opaque violet-blue tone
(much more vivid and higher in key than the same
berries can show when picked and brought to
market) were so large and so thickly crowded as
to almost hide the leaves. They gave the austere
steeps of &ldquo;Old Baldy&rdquo; the effect of having been
dyed with a wash of cobalt.</p>
</div>
<p>Far below, where the lonely wilderness valley
was already forsaken by the sun, a flock of ducks
could be seen, with long, outstretched necks rigid
and short wings swiftly beating, lined out over a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
breadth of wild meadow. Above the lake which
washed the foot of the mountain,&ndash;&ndash;high above the
water, but below the line of shadow creeping up
the mountain&rsquo;s face,&ndash;&ndash;a single fish-hawk circled
slowly, waiting for the twilight coolness to bring
the big trout to the surface to feed. The smooth
water glimmered pallidly, and here and there a
spreading, circular ripple showed that the hungry
fish were beginning to rise.</p>
<p>Up in the flood of the sunset, the blueberries
basked and glowed, some looking like gems, some
like blossoms, according to the fall of the light.
Around the shoulder of the mountain toward the
east, where the direct rays of the sun could not
reach, the light was yet abundant, but cool and tender,&ndash;&ndash;and
here the vivid berries were beginning to
lose their colour, as a curved moon, just rising over
the far, ragged rim of the forest, touched them
with phantom silver. Everywhere jutting rocks
and sharp crevices broke the soft mantle of the blueberry
thickets; and on the southerly slope, where
sunset and moonrise mingled with intricate shadows,
everything looked ghostlike and unreal. On
the utmost summit of the mountain a rounded peak
of white granite, smoothed by ages of storm, shone
like a beacon.</p>

&ldquo;AN OLD SHE-BEAR WITH TWO HALF-GROWN CUBS.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>The only berry-pickers that came to these high
slopes of Bald Mountain were the wild kindreds,
furred and feathered. Of them all, none were more
enthusiastic and assiduous than the bears; and just
now, climbing up eagerly from the darkening woods
below, came an old she-bear with two half-grown
cubs. They came up by easy paths, zigzagging
past boulder and crevice, through the ghostly, noiseless
contention of sunlight and moonlight. Now
their moving shadows lay one way, now the other;
and now their shadows were suddenly wiped out, as
the two lights for a moment held an even balance.
At length having reached a little plateau where the
berries were particularly large and close-clustered,
the old bear stopped, and they fell joyously to their
feeding.</p>
<p>On these open heights there were no enemies
to keep watch against, and there was no reason
to be wary or silent. The bears fed noisily, therefore,
stripping the plump fruit cleverly by the pawful,
and munching with little, greedy grunts of
delight. There was no other food quite so to their
taste as these berries, unless, perhaps, a well-filled
honey-comb. And this was their season for eating,
eating, eating, all the time, in order to lay up abundant
fat against the long severity of winter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>As the bushes about them were stripped of the
best fruit, the shaggy feasters moved around the
shoulder of the mountain from the gold of the sun
into the silver of the moon. Soon the sunset had
faded, and the moon had it all her own way except
for a broad expanse of sea-green sky in the west,
deepening through violet to a narrow streak of
copper on the horizon. By this time the shadows,
especially on the eastern slope, were very sharp
and black, and the open spaces very white and radiant,
with a strange transparency borrowed from
that high, pure atmosphere.</p>
<p>It chanced that the little hollow on which the
bears were just now revelling,&ndash;&ndash;a hollow where
the blueberries were unbelievably large and abundant&ndash;&ndash;was
bounded on its upper side, toward the
steep, by a narrow and deep crevice. At one end
of the cleft, from a rocky and shallow roothold, a
gnarled birch grew slantingly. From its unusual
situation, and from the fact that the bushes grew
thick to its very edge, this crevice constituted nothing
less than a most insidious trap.</p>
<p>One of the cubs, born with the instinct of caution,
kept far away from the dangerous brink without
having more than half realized that there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
any danger there whatever. The other cub was
one of those blundering fellows, to be found among
the wild kindreds no less than among the kindreds
of men, who only get caution hammered into them
by experience. He saw a narrow break, indeed,
between the berry patch and the bare steep above,&ndash;&ndash;but
what was a little crevice in a position like
this, where it could not amount to anything? Had
it been on the other side of the hollow, he would
have feared a precipice, and would have been on
his guard. But, as it was, he never gave the matter
a second thought, because it did not look dangerous!
He found the best berries growing very
near the edge of the crevice; and in his satisfaction
he turned his back to the height and settled himself
solidly upon his haunches to enjoy them. As he
did so the bushes gave way behind him, he pitched
abruptly backwards, and vanished with a squeal
of terror into the narrow cleft of darkness.</p>
<p>The crevice was perhaps twelve feet deep, and
from five to eight in width all the way to the bottom.
The bottom held a layer of earth and dead
leaves, which served to ease the cub&rsquo;s fall; but
when he landed the wind was so bumped out of
him that for a minute or two he could not utter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
a sound. As soon as he recovered his voice, however,
he began to squeal and whine piteously for
his mother.</p>
<p>The old bear, at the sound of his cry as he fell,
had rushed so hastily to his aid that she barely
escaped falling in after him. Checking herself just
in time, by digging all her mighty claws into the
roots of the blueberries, she crouched at the brink,
thrust her head as far over as she could, and peered
down with anxious cries. But when the cub&rsquo;s voice
came back to her from the darkness she knew he
was not killed, and she also knew that he was very
near,&ndash;&ndash;and her whinings changed at once to a
guttural murmur that must have been intended for
encouragement. The other cub, meanwhile, had
come lumbering up with ears wisely cocked, taken
a very hasty and careful glance over the edge, and
returned to his blueberries with an air of disapproval.
It was as if he said he always knew that
blundering brother of his would get himself into
trouble.</p>
<p>For some minutes the old bear crouched where
she was, straining her eyes to make out the form
of her little one. Becoming accustomed to the
gloom at last, she could discern him. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
see that he was moving about, and standing on his
hind legs, and striving valiantly to claw his way
up the perpendicular surface of smooth rock. She
began to reach downwards first one big forepaw
and then the other, testing the rock beneath her
for some ledge or crack that might give her foothold
by which to climb down to his aid. Finding
none, she again set up her uneasy whining, and
moved slowly along the brink, trying every inch of
the way for some place rough enough to give her
strong claws a chance to take hold. In the full,
unclouded light of the white moon she was a pathetic
figure, bending and crouching and straining,
and reaching down longingly, then stopping to
listen to the complaints of pain and terror that
came up out of the dark.</p>
<p>At last she came to the end of the crevice where
grew the solitary birch tree,&ndash;&ndash;the frightened captive
following exactly below her and stretching up
toward her against the rock. At this point, close
beside the tree, some roots and tough turf overhung
the edge, and the old bear&rsquo;s paws detected
a roughness on the face of the rock just below.
This was enough for her brave and devoted heart.
She turned around and let her hind quarters carefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
over the brink, intending to climb down backwards
as bears do. But beyond the first unevenness
there was absolutely nothing that her claws
could take hold of. Her great body was half way
over, when she felt herself on the point of falling.
Making a sudden startled effort to recover herself,
she clutched desperately at the trunk of the birch
tree with one arm, at the roots of the berry-bushes
with the other,&ndash;&ndash;and just managed to regain the
level.</p>
<p>For herself, this mighty effort was just enough.
But for the birch-tree it was just too much. The
shallow earth by which it held gave way; and the
next moment, with a clatter of loosened stones and
a swish of leafy branches, it crashed majestically
down into the crevice, closing one end of it with
a mass of boughs and foliage, and once more
frightening the imprisoned cub almost out of his
senses.</p>
<p>At the first sound of this cataclysm, at the first
rattle of loose earth about his ears, the cub had
bounced madly to the other end of the crevice,
where he crouched, whimpering. The old bear,
too, was daunted for some seconds; but then, seeing
that the cub was not hurt, she was quick to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
perceive the advantage of the accident. Standing
at the upturned roots of the tree, she called eagerly
and encouragingly to the cub, pointing out the path
of escape thus offered to him. For some minutes
he was too terrified to approach. At last she set
her own weight on the trunk, testing it, and prepared
to climb down and lead him out. At this,
however, the youngster&rsquo;s nerve revived. With a
joyful and understanding squeal, he rushed forward,
sprawled and clawed his way over the tangle
of branches, gained the firm trunk,&ndash;&ndash;and presently
found himself again beside his mother among the
pleasant, moonlit berry-bushes. Here he was fondled
and nosed and licked and nursed by the delighted
mother, till his bruised little body forgot
its hurts and his shaken little heart its fears. His
cautious brother, too, came up with a wise look
and sniffed at him patronizingly; but went away
again with his nose in the air, as if to say that here
was much fuss being made over a very small matter.</p>

<h2>The Glutton of the Great Snow</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/N.png" title="" alt="N" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">NORTHWARD</span> interminably, and beneath
a whitish, desolate sky, stretched the
white, empty leagues of snow, unbroken
by rock or tree or hill, to the straight, menacing
horizon. Green-black, and splotched with snow
that clung here and there upon their branches, along
the southward limits of the barren crowded down
the serried ranks of the ancient fir forest. Endlessly
baffled, but endlessly unconquered, the hosts
of the firs thrust out their grim spire-topped vanguards,
at intervals, into the hostile vacancy of the
barren. Between these dark vanguards, long, silent
aisles of whiteness led back and gently upward into
the heart of the forest.</p>
</div>
<p>Out across one of these pale corridors of silence
came moving very deliberately a dark, squat shape
with blunt muzzle close to the snow. Its keen, fierce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
eyes and keener nostrils were scrutinizing the white
surface for the scent or trail of some other forest
wanderer. Conscious of power, in spite of its comparatively
small stature&ndash;&ndash;much less than that of
wolf or lynx, or even of the fox&ndash;&ndash;it made no
effort to conceal its movements, disguise its track
or keep watch for possible enemies. Stronger than
any other beast of thrice its size, as cunning as the
wisest of the foxes, and of a dogged, savage temper
well known to all the kindred of the wild, it
seemed to feel secure from ill-considered interference.</p>
<p>Less than three feet in length, but of peculiarly
massive build, this dark, ominous-looking animal
walked flat-footed, like a bear, and with a surly
heaviness worthy of a bear&rsquo;s stature. Its fur,
coarse and long, was of a sooty gray-brown,
streaked coarsely down each flank with a broad
yellowish splash meeting over the hind quarters.
Its powerful, heavy-clawed feet were black. Its
short muzzle and massive jaw, and its broad face
up to just above the eyes, where the fur came down
thickly, were black also. The eyes themselves, peering
out beneath overhanging brows, gleamed with
a mixture of sullen intelligence and implacable savagery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
In its slow, forbidding strength, and in its
tameless reserve, which yet held the capacity for
outbursts of ungovernable rage, this strange beast
seemed to incarnate the very spirit of the bitter and
indomitable North. Its name was various, for
hunters called it sometimes wolverene, sometimes
carcajou, but oftener &ldquo;Glutton,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Injun Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the voiceless desolation the carcajou&ndash;&ndash;it
was a female&ndash;&ndash;continued her leisurely way.
Presently, just upon the edge of the forest-growth,
she came upon the fresh track of a huge lynx. The
prints of the lynx&rsquo;s great pads were several times
broader than her own, but she stopped and began
to examine them without the slightest trace of apprehension.
For some reason best known to herself,
she at length made up her mind to pursue the
stranger&rsquo;s back trail, concerning herself rather with
what he had been doing than with what he was
about to do.</p>
<p>Plunging into the gloom of the firs, where the
trail led over a snow-covered chaos of boulders and
tangled windfalls, she came presently to a spot
where the snow was disturbed and scratched. Her
eyes sparkled greedily. There were spatters of
blood about the place, and she realized that here the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
lynx had buried, for a future meal, the remnant of
his kill.</p>
<p>Her keen nose speedily told her just where the
treasure was hidden, and she fell to digging furiously
with her short, powerful fore paws. It was
a bitter and lean season, and the lynx, after eating
his fill, had taken care to bury the remnant deep.
The carcajou burrowed down till only the tip of
her dingy tail was visible before she found the object
of her search. It proved to be nothing but one
hind quarter of a little blue fox. Angrily she
dragged it forth and bolted it in a twinkling,
crunching the slim bone between her powerful jaws.
It was but a morsel to such a hunger as hers. Licking
her chops, and passing her black paws hurriedly
over her face, as a cat does, she forsook the trail
of the lynx and wandered on deeper into the soundless
gloom. Several rabbit-tracks she crossed, and
here and there the dainty trail of a ptarmigan, or
the small, sequential dots of a weasel&rsquo;s foot. But
a single glance or passing twitch of her nostril told
her these were all old, and she vouchsafed them no
attention. It was not till she had gone perhaps a
quarter of a mile through the fir-glooms that she
came upon a trail which caused her to halt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>It was the one trail, this, among all the tracks
that traversed the great snow, which could cause
her a moment&rsquo;s perturbation. For the trail of the
wolf-pack she had small concern&ndash;&ndash;for the hungriest
wolves could never climb a tree. But this was
the broad snowshoe trail, which she knew was
made by a creature even more crafty than herself.
She glanced about keenly, peering under the trees&ndash;&ndash;because
one could never judge, merely by the
direction of the trail, where one of those dangerous
creatures was going. She stood almost erect
on her haunches and sniffed the air for the slightest
taint of danger. Then she sniffed at the tracks.
The man-smell was strong upon them, and comparatively,
but not dangerously, fresh. Reassured
on this point, she decided to follow the man and
find out what he was doing. It was only when she
did not know what he was about that she so dreaded
him. Given the opportunity to watch him unseen,
she was willing enough to pit her cunning against
his, and to rob him as audaciously as she would
rob any of the wilderness kindreds.</p>
<p>Hunting over a wide range as she did, the carcajou
was unaware till now that a man had come
upon her range that winter. To her experience a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
man meant a hunter&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;trapper, with emphasis
distinctly upon the trapper. The man&rsquo;s gun she
feared&ndash;&ndash;but his traps she feared not at all. Indeed,
she regarded them rather with distinct favour,
and was ready to profit by them at the first
opportunity. Having only strength and cunning,
but no speed to rely upon, she had learned that
traps could catch all kinds of swift creatures, and
hold them inexorably. She had learned, too, that
there was usually a succession of traps and snares
set along a man&rsquo;s trail. It was with some exciting
expectation, now, that she applied herself to following
this trail.</p>
<p>Within a short distance the track brought her to
a patch of trampled snow, with tiny bits of frozen
fish scattered about. She knew at once that somewhere
in this disturbed area a trap was hidden, close
to the surface. Stepping warily, in a circle, she
picked up and devoured the smallest scraps. Near
the centre lay a fragment of tempting size; but she
cunningly guessed that close beside that morsel
would be the hiding-place of the trap. Slowly she
closed in upon it, her nose close to the snow, sniffing
with cautious discrimination. Suddenly she
stopped short. Through the snow she had detected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
the man-smell, and the smell of steel, mingling with
the savour of the dried fish. Here, but a little to
one side, she began to dig, and promptly uncovered
a light chain. Following this she came presently
to the trap itself, which she cautiously laid bare.
Then, without misgiving, she ate the big piece of
fish. Both her curiosity and her hunger, however,
were still far from satisfied, so she again took up
the trail.</p>
<p>The next trap she came to was an open snare&ndash;&ndash;a
noose of bright wire suspended near the head of
a cunningly constructed alley of fir branches, leading
up to the foot of a big hemlock. Just behind
this noose, and hardly to be reached save through
the noose, the bait had evidently been fixed. But
the carcajou saw that some one little less cunning
than herself had been before her. Such a snare
would have caught the fierce, but rather stupid,
lynx; but a fox had been the first arrival. She saw
his tracks. He had carefully investigated the alley
of fir branches from the outside. Then he had
broken through it behind the noose, and safely
made off with the bait. Rather contemptuously the
old wolverene went on. She did not understand
this kind of trap, so she discreetly refrained from
meddling with it.</p>

&ldquo;CREPT SLOWLY AROUND THE RAGING AND SNARLING CAPTIVE.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Fully a quarter mile she had to go before she
came to another; but here she found things altogether
different and more interesting. As she came
softly around a great snow-draped boulder there
was a snarl, a sharp rattle of steel, and a thud.
She shrank back swiftly, just beyond reach of the
claws of a big lynx. The lynx had been ahead of
her in discovering the trap, and with the stupidity
of his tribe had got caught in it. The inexorable
steel jaws had him fast by the left fore leg. He
had heard the almost soundless approach of the
strange prowler, and, mad with pain and rage, had
sprung to the attack without waiting to see the
nature of his antagonist.</p>
<p>Keeping just beyond the range of his hampered
leap, the carcajou now crept slowly around the
raging and snarling captive, who kept pouncing at
her in futile fury every other moment. Though
his superior in sheer strength, she was much smaller
and lighter than he, and less murderously armed
for combat; and she dreaded the raking, eviscerating
clutch of his terrible hinder claws. In defence
of her burrow and her litter, she would have
tackled him without hesitation; but her sharp teeth
and bulldog jaw, however efficient, would not avail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
in such a combat, to save her from getting ripped
almost to ribbons. She was far too sagacious to
enter upon any such struggle unnecessarily. Prowling
slowly and tirelessly, without effort, around
and around the excited prisoner, she trusted to wear
him out and then take him at some deadly disadvantage.</p>
<p>Weighted with the trap, and not wise enough to
refrain from wasting his strength in vain struggles,
the lynx was strenuously playing his cunning antagonist&rsquo;s
game, when a sound came floating on the
still air which made them both instantly rigid. It
was a long, thin, wavering cry that died off with
indescribable melancholy in its cadence. The lynx
crouched, with eyes dilating, and listened with terrible
intentness. The carcajou, equally interested
but not terrified, stood erect, ears, eyes and nose
alike directed to finding out more about that ominous
voice. Again and again it was repeated,
swiftly coming nearer; and presently it resolved
itself into a chorus of voices. The lynx made several
convulsive bounds, wrenching desperately to
free his imprisoned limb; then, recognizing the
inevitable, he crouched again, shuddering but dangerous,
his tufted ears flattened upon his back, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
eyes flickering green, every tooth and claw bared
for the last battle. But the carcajou merely stiffened
up her fur, in a rage at the prospective interruption
of her hunting. She knew well that the
dreadful, melancholy cry was the voice of the wolf-pack.
But the wolves were not on <i>her</i> trail, that
she was sure of; and possibly they might pass at
a harmless distance, and not discover her or her
quarry.</p>
<p>The listeners were not kept long in suspense.
The pack, as it chanced, was on the trail of a moose
which, labouring heavily in the deep snow, had
passed, at a distance of some thirty or forty yards,
a few minutes before the carcajou&rsquo;s arrival. The
wolves swept into view through the tall fir trunks&ndash;&ndash;five
in number, and running so close that a
table-cloth might have covered them. They knew
by the trail that the quarry must be near, and,
urged on by the fierce thrust of their hunger, they
were not looking to right or left. They were almost
past, and the lynx was beginning to take heart
again, when, out of the tail of his eye, the pack-leader
detected something unusual on the snow near
the foot of the big rock. One fair look explained
it all to him. With an exultant yelp he turned, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
the pack swept down upon the prisoner; while the
carcajou, bursting with indignation, slipped up the
nearest tree.</p>
<p>The captive was not abject, but game to the last
tough fibre. All fangs and rending claws, with a
screech and a bound he met the onslaught of the
pack; and, for all the hideous handicap of that
thing of iron on his leg, he gave a good account of
himself. For a minute or two the wolves and their
victim formed one yelling, yelping heap. When it
disentangled itself, three of the wolves were badly
torn, and one had the whole side of his face laid
open. But in a few minutes there was nothing left
of the unfortunate lynx but a few of the heavier
bones&ndash;&ndash;to which the pack might return later&ndash;&ndash;and
the scrap of fur and flesh that was held in the
jaws of the trap.</p>

&ldquo;SNAPPED BACK AT HIM WITH A VICIOUS GROWL.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>As the carcajou saw her prospective meal disappearing,
her rage became almost uncontrollable,
and she crept down the tree-trunk as if she would
fling herself upon the pack. The leader sprang at
her, leaping as high as he could against the trunk;
and she, barely out of reach of his clashing, bloody
fangs, snapped back at him with a vicious growl,
trying to catch the tip of his nose. Failing in this,
she struck at him like lightning with her powerful
claws, raking his muzzle so severely that he fell
back with a startled yelp. A moment later the
whole pack, their famine still unsatisfied, swept off
again upon the trail of the moose. The carcajou
came down, sniffed angrily at the clean bones which
had been cracked for their marrow, then hurried
off on the track of the wolves.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, it had chanced that the man on snowshoes,
fetching a wide circle that would bring the
end of his line of traps back nearly to his cabin,
had come suddenly face to face with the fleeing
moose. Worn out with the terror of his flight and
the heart-breaking effort of floundering through the
heavy snow&ndash;&ndash;which was, nevertheless, hard
enough, on the surface, to bear up his light-footed
pursuers&ndash;&ndash;the great beast was near his last gasp.
At sight of the man before him, more to be dreaded
even than the savage foe behind him, he snorted
wildly and plunged off to one side. But the man,
borne up upon his snowshoes, overtook him in a
moment, and, suddenly stooping forward, drew his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
long hunting-knife across the gasping throat. The
snow about grew crimson instantly, and the huge
beast sank with a shudder.</p>
<p>The trapper knew that a moose so driven must
have had enemies on its trail, and he knew also that
no enemies but wolves, or another hunter, could
have driven the moose to such a flight. There was
no other hunter ranging within twenty miles of
him. Therefore, it was wolves. He had no
weapon with him but his knife and his light axe,
because his rifle was apt to be a useless burden in
winter, when he had always traps or pelts to carry.
And it was rash for one man, without his gun, to
rob a wolf-pack of its kill! But the trapper wanted
fresh moose-meat. Hastily and skilfully he began
to cut from the carcass the choicest portions of
haunch and loin. He had no more than fairly got
to work when the far-off cry of the pack sounded
on his expectant ears. He laboured furiously as the
voices drew nearer. The interruption of the lynx
he understood, in a measure, by the noises that
reached him; but when the pack came hot on the
trail again he knew it was time to get away. He
must retreat promptly, but not be seen retreating.
Bearing with him such cuts as he had been able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
to secure, he made off in the direction of his cabin.
But at a distance of about two hundred yards he
stepped into a thicket at the base of a huge hemlock,
and turned to see what the wolves would do
when they found they had been forestalled. As he
turned, the wolves appeared, and swept down upon
the body of the moose. But within a couple of
paces of it they stopped short, with a snarl of suspicion,
and drew back hastily. The tracks and the
scent of their arch-enemy, man, were all about the
carcass. His handiwork&ndash;&ndash;his clean cutting&ndash;&ndash;was
evident upon it. Their first impulse was toward
caution. Suspecting a trap, they circled warily
about the body. Then, reassured, their rage blazed
up. Their own quarry had been killed before them,
their own hunting insolently crossed. However, it
was man, the ever-insolent overlord, who had done
it. He had taken toll as he would, and withdrawn
when he would. They did not quite dare to follow
and seek vengeance. So in a few moments their
wrath had simmered down; and they fell savagely
upon the yet warm feast.</p>
<p>The trapper watched them from his hiding-place,
not wishing to risk attracting their attention before
they had quite gorged themselves. He knew there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
would be plenty of good meat left, even then; and
that they would at length proceed to bury it for
future use. Then he could dig it up again, take
what remained clean and unmauled, and leave the
rest to its lawful owners; and all without unnecessary
trouble.</p>
<p>As he watched the banqueting pack, he was suddenly
conscious of a movement in the branches of
a fir a little beyond them. Then his quick eye,
keener in discrimination than that of any wolf,
detected the sturdy figure of a large wolverene making
its way from tree to tree at a safe distance
above the snow, intent upon the wolves. What one
carcajou&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Glutton,&rdquo; he called it&ndash;&ndash;could hope,
for all its cunning, to accomplish against five big
timber-wolves, he could not imagine. Hating the
&ldquo;Glutton,&rdquo; as all trappers do, he wished most earnestly
that it might slip on its branch and fall down
before the fangs of the pack.</p>
<p>There was no smallest danger of the wary carcajou
doing anything of the sort. Every faculty
was on the alert to avenge herself on the wolves
who had robbed her of her destined prey. Most
of the other creatures of the wild she despised, but
the wolves she also hated, because she felt herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
constrained to yield them way. She crawled carefully
from tree to tree, till at last she gained one
whose lower branches spread directly over the carcass
of the moose. Creeping out upon one of those
branches, she glared down maliciously upon her
foes. Observing her, two of the wolves desisted
long enough from their feasting to leap up at her
with fiercely gnashing teeth. But finding her out
of reach, and scornfully unmoved by their futile
demonstrations, they gave it up and fell again to
their ravenous feasting.</p>
<p>The wolverene is a big cousin to the weasel, and
also to the skunk. The ferocity of the weasel it
shares, and the weasel&rsquo;s dauntless courage. Its kinship
to the skunk is attested by the possession of
a gland which secretes an oil of peculiarly potent
malodour. The smell of this oil is not so overpowering,
so pungently strangulating, as that
emitted by the skunk; but all the wild creatures
find it irresistibly disgusting. No matter how
pinched and racked by famine they may be, not
one of them will touch a morsel of meat which a
wolverene has defiled ever so slightly. The wolverene
itself, however, by no means shares this
general prejudice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>When the carcajou had glared down upon the
wolves for several minutes, she ejected the contents
of her oil-gland all over the body of the moose,
impartially treating her foes to a portion of the
nauseating fluid. With coughing, and sneezing,
and furious yelping, the wolves bounded away, and
began rolling and burrowing in the snow. They
could not rid themselves at once of the dreadful
odour; but, presently recovering their self-possession,
and resolutely ignoring the polluted meat,
they ranged themselves in a circle around the tree
at a safe distance, and snapped their long jaws
vengefully at their adversary. They seemed prepared
to stay there indefinitely, in the hope of starving
out the carcajou and tearing her to pieces.
Perceiving this, the carcajou turned her back upon
them, climbed farther up the tree to a comfortable
crotch, and settled herself indifferently for a nap.
For all her voracious appetite, she knew she could
go hungry longer than any wolf, and quite wear
out the pack in a waiting game. Then the trapper,
indignant at seeing so much good meat spoiled,
but his sporting instincts stirred to sympathy by
the triumph of one beast like the carcajou over a
whole wolf-pack, turned his back upon the scene
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and resumed his tramp. The wolves had lost prestige
in his eyes, and he now felt ready to fight them
all with his single axe.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>From that day on the wolf-pack cherished a
sleepless grudge against the carcajou, and wasted
precious hours, from time to time, striving to catch
her off her guard. The wolf&rsquo;s memory is a long
one, and the feud lost nothing in its bitterness as
the winter weeks, loud with storm or still with
deadly cold, dragged by. For a time the crafty old
carcajou fed fat on the flesh which none but she
could touch, while all the other beasts but the bear,
safe asleep in his den, and the porcupine, browsing
contentedly on hemlock and spruce, went lean with
famine. During this period, since she had all that
even her great appetite could dispose of, the carcajou
robbed neither the hunter&rsquo;s traps nor the
scant stores of the other animals. But at last her
larder was bare. Then, turning her attention to
the traps again, she speedily drew upon her the
trapper&rsquo;s wrath, and found herself obliged to keep
watch against two foes at once, and they the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
powerful in the wilderness&ndash;&ndash;namely, the man and
the wolf-pack. Even the magnitude of this feud,
however, did not daunt her greedy but fearless
spirit, and she continued to rob the traps, elude the
wolves, and evade the hunter&rsquo;s craftiest efforts, till
the approach of spring not only eased the famine
of the forest but put an end to the man&rsquo;s trapping.
When the furs of the wild kindred began to lose
their gloss and vitality, the trapper loaded his pelts
upon a big hand-sledge, sealed up his cabin securely,
and set out for the settlements before the
snow should all be gone. Once assured of his absence,
the carcajou devoted all her strength and
cunning to making her way into the closed cabin.
At last, after infinite patience and endeavour, she
managed to get in, through the roof. There were
supplies&ndash;&ndash;flour, and bacon, and dried apples, all
very much to her distinctly catholic taste&ndash;&ndash;and
she enjoyed herself immensely till private duties
summoned her reluctantly away.</p>
<p>Spring comes late to the great snows, but when
it does come it is swift and not to be denied. Then
summer, with much to do and little time to do it in,
rushes ardently down upon the plains and the fir-forests.
About three miles back from the cabin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
on a dry knoll in the heart of a tangled swamp, the
old wolverene dug herself a commodious and secret
burrow. Here she gave birth to a litter of tiny
young ones, much like herself in miniature, only of
a paler colour and softer, silkier fur. In her ardent,
unflagging devotion to these little ones she
undertook no hunting that would take her far from
home, but satisfied her appetite with mice, slugs,
worms and beetles.</p>
<p>Living in such seclusion as she did, her enemies
the wolves lost all track of her for the time. The
pack had broken up, as a formal organization, according
to the custom of wolf-packs in summer.
But there was still more or less cohesion, of a sort,
between its scattered members; and the leader and
his mate had a cave not many miles from the wolverene&rsquo;s
retreat.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, the gray old leader, returning
to the cave one day with the body of a rabbit
between his gaunt jaws, took a short cut across
the swamp, and came upon the trail of his long-lost
enemy. In fact, he came upon several of her
trails; and he understood very well what it meant.
He had no time, or inclination, to stop and look
into the matter then; but his sagacious eyes gleamed
with vengeful intention as he continued his journey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>About this time&ndash;&ndash;the time being a little past
midsummer&ndash;&ndash;the man came back to his cabin,
bringing supplies. It was a long journey between
the cabin and the settlements, and he had to make
it several times during the brief summer, in order
to accumulate stores enough to last through the
long, merciless season of the great snows. When
he reached the cabin and found that, in spite of all
his precautions, the greedy carcajou had outwitted
him and broken in, and pillaged his stores, his indignation
knew no bounds.</p>
<p>The carcajou had become an enemy more dangerous
to him than all the other beasts of the wild
together. She must be hunted down and destroyed
before he could go on with his business of laying
in stores for the winter.</p>
<p>For several days the man prowled in ever-widening
circles around his cabin, seeking to pick up his
enemy&rsquo;s fresh trail. At last, late one afternoon, he
found it, on the outskirts of the swamp. It was
too late to follow it up then. But the next day he
set out betimes with rifle, axe and spade, vowed to
the extermination of the whole carcajou family,
for he knew, as well as the old wolf did, why the
carcajou had taken up her quarters in the swamp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>It chanced that this very morning was the morning
when the wolves had undertaken to settle their
ancient grudge. The old leader&ndash;&ndash;his mate being
occupied with her cubs&ndash;&ndash;had managed to get hold
of two other members of the pack, with memories
as long as his. The unravelling of the trails in the
swamp was an easy task for their keen noses.
They found the burrow on the dry, warm knoll,
prowled stealthily all about it for a few minutes,
then set themselves to digging it open. When the
man, whose wary, moccasined feet went noiselessly
as a fox&rsquo;s, came in eyeshot of the knoll, the sight
he caught through the dark jumble of tree-trunks
brought him to a stop. He slunk behind a screen
of branches and peered forth with eager interest.
What he saw was three big, gray wolves, starting
to dig furiously. He knew they were digging at
the carcajou&rsquo;s burrow.</p>
<p>When the wolves fell to digging their noses told
them that there were young carcajous in the burrow,
but they could not be sure whether the old one
was at home or not. On this point, however, they
were presently informed. As the dry earth flew
from beneath their furious claws, a dark, blunt
snout shot forth, to be as swiftly withdrawn. Its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
appearance was followed by a yelp of pain, and
one of the younger wolves drew back, walking on
three legs. One fore paw had been bitten clean
through, and he lay down whining, to lick and
cherish it. That paw, at least, would do no more
digging for some time.</p>
<p>The man, in his hiding-place behind the screen,
saw what had happened, and felt a twinge of sympathetic
admiration for his enemy, the savage little
fighter in the burrow. The remaining two wolves
now grew more cautious, keeping back from the
entrance as well as they could, and undermining
its edges. Again and again the dark muzzle shot
forth, but the wolves always sprang away in time
to escape punishment. This went on till the wolves
had made such an excavation that the man thought
they must be nearing the bottom of the den. He
waited breathlessly for the d&eacute;nouement, which he
knew would be exciting.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait.</p>
<p>On a sudden, as if jerked from a catapult, the
old carcajou sprang clear out, snatching at the
muzzle of the nearest wolf. He dodged, but not
quite far enough; and she caught him fairly in the
side of the throat, just behind the jaw. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
deadly grip, and the wolf rose on his hind legs,
struggling frantically to shake her off. But with
her great strength and powerful, clutching claws,
which she used almost as a bear might, she pulled
him down on top of her, striving to use his bulk
as a shield against the fangs of the other wolf; and
the two rolled over and over to the foot of the
knoll.</p>
<p>It was the second young wolf, unfortunately for
her, that she had fastened upon, or the victory,
even against such odds, might have been hers.
But the old leader was wary. He saw that his
comrade was done for; so he stood watchful, biding
his chance to get just the grip he wanted.
At length, as he saw the younger wolf&rsquo;s struggles
growing feebler, he darted in and slashed the carcajou
frightfully across the loins. But this was
not the hold that he wanted. As she dropped her
victim and turned upon him valiantly, he caught
her high up on the back, and held her fast between
his bone-crushing jaws. It was a final and fatal
grip; but she was not beaten until she was dead.
With her fierce eyes already glazing she writhed
about and succeeded in fixing her death-grip upon
the victor&rsquo;s lean fore leg. With the last ounce of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
her strength, the last impulses of her courage and
her hate, she clinched her jaws till her teeth met
through flesh, sinew and the cracking bone itself.
Then her lifeless body went limp, and with a swing
of his massive neck the old wolf flung her from
him.</p>
<p>Having satisfied himself that she was quite dead,
the old wolf now slunk off on three legs into the
swamp, holding his maimed and bleeding limb as
high as he could. Then the man stepped out from
his hiding-place and came forward. The wolf who
had been first bitten got up and limped away with
surprising agility; but the one in whose throat the
old carcajou had fixed her teeth lay motionless
where he had fallen, a couple of paces from his
dead slayer. Wolf-pelts were no good at this season,
so the man thrust the body carelessly aside
with his foot. But he stood for a minute or two
looking down with whimsical respect on the dead
form of the carcajou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nawthin&rsquo; but a thief an&rsquo; stinkin&rsquo; Glutton,&rdquo;
he muttered presently, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the whole kit an&rsquo;
bilin&rsquo; of ye&rsquo;s got to be wiped out! But, when it
comes to grit, clean through, I takes off my cap
to ye!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>When the Truce of the Wild is Done</h2>
</div>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/B.png" title="" alt="B" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">BY</span> day it was still high summer in the
woods, with slumbrous heat at noon, and
the murmur of insects under the thick
foliage. But to the initiated sense there was a difference.
A tang in the forest scents told the nostrils
that autumn had arrived. A crispness in the
feel of the air, elusive but persistent, hinted of approaching
frost. The still warmth was haunted,
every now and then, by a passing ghost of chill.
Here and there the pale green of the birches was
thinly webbed with gold. Here and there a maple
hung out amid its rich verdure a branch prematurely
turned, glowing like a banner of a&euml;rial rose.
Along the edges of the little wild meadows which
bordered the loitering brooks the first thin blooms
of the asters began to show, like a veil of blown
smoke. In open patches, on the hillsides the goldenrod
burned orange and the fireweed spread its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
washes of violet pink. Somewhere in the top of a
tall poplar, crowning the summit of a glaring white
bluff, a locust twanged incessantly its strident
string. Mysteriously, imperceptibly, without sound
and without warning, the change had come.</p>
</div>
<p>Hardly longer ago than yesterday, the wild creatures
had been unwary and confident, showing
themselves everywhere. The partridge coveys had
whirred up noisily in full view of the passing
woodsman, and craned their necks to watch him
from the near-by branches. On every shallow mere
and tranquil river-reach the flocks of wild ducks had
fed boldly, suffering canoe or punt to come within
easy gunshot. In the heavy grass of the wild meadows,
or among the long, washing sedges of the lakeside,
the red deer had pastured openly in the broad
daylight, with tramplings and splashings, and had
lifted large bright eyes of unterrified curiosity if
a boat or canoe happened by. The security of that
great truce, which men called &ldquo;close season&rdquo; had
rested sweetly on the forest.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, when the sunrise was pink on the
mists, a gunshot had sent the echoes clamouring
across the still lake waters, and a flock of ducks,
flapping up and fleeing with frightened cries, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
left one of its members sprawling motionless among
the flattened sedge, a heap of bright feathers spattered
with blood. Later in the morning a rifle had
cracked sharply on the hillside, and a little puff of
white smoke had blown across the dark front of the
fir groves. The truce had come to an end.</p>
<p>All summer long men had kept the truce with
strictness, and the hunter&rsquo;s fierce instinct, curbed
alike by law and foresight, had slumbered. But
now the young coveys were full-fledged and strong
of wing, well able to care for themselves. The
young ducks were full grown, and no longer needed
their mother&rsquo;s guardianship and teaching. The
young deer were learning to shift for themselves,
and finding, to their wonder and indignation, that
their mothers grew day by day more indifferent to
them, more inclined to wander off in search of new
interests. The time had come when the young of
the wilderness stood no longer in need of protection.
Then the hand of the law was lifted.</p>
<p>Instantly in the hearts of men the hunter&rsquo;s fever
flamed up, and, with eager eyes, they went forth
to kill. Where they had yesterday walked openly,
hardly heeding the wild creatures about them, they
now crept stealthily, following the trails, or lying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
in ambush, waiting for the unsuspicious flock to
wing past. And when they found that the game,
yesterday so abundant and unwatchful, had to-day
almost wholly disappeared, they were indignant,
and wished that they had anticipated the season by
a few hours.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the time of the ending of the
truce was not the same for all the wild creatures
which had profited by its protection through the
spring and summer. Certain of the tribes, according
to the law&rsquo;s provisions, were secure for some
weeks longer yet. But this they never seemed to
realize. As far as they could observe, when the
truce was broken for one it was broken for all, and
all took alarm together. In some unexplained way,
perhaps by the mere transmission of a general fear,
word went around that the time had come for invisibility
and craft. All at once, therefore, as it
seemed to men, the wilderness had become empty.</p>
<p>Down a green, rough wood-road, leading from
the Settlement to one of the wild meadows by the
river, came a young man in homespun carrying a
long, old-fashioned, muzzle-loading duck-gun. Two
days before this he had seen a fine buck, with antlers
perfect and new-shining from the velvet, feeding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
on the edge of this meadow. The young woodsman
had his gun loaded with buckshot. He wanted
both venison and a pair of horns; and, knowing
the fancy of the deer for certain favourite pastures,
he had great hopes of finding the buck somewhere
about the place where he had last seen him. With
flexible &ldquo;larrigans&rdquo; of oiled cowhide on his feet,
the hunter moved noiselessly and swiftly as a panther,
his keen pale-blue eyes peering from side to
side through the shadowy undergrowth. Not three
steps aside from the path, moveless as a stone and
invisible among the spotted weeds and twigs, a
crafty old cock-partridge stood with head erect and
unwinking eyes and watched the dangerous intruder
stride by.</p>
<p>Approaching the edge of the open, the young
hunter kept himself carefully hidden behind the
fringing leafage and looked forth upon the little
meadow. No creature being in sight, he cut
straight across the grass to the water&rsquo;s edge, and
scanned the muddy margin for foot-prints. These
he presently found in abundance, along between
grass and sedge. Most of the marks were old; but
others were so fresh that he knew the buck must
have been there and departed within the last ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
minutes. Into some deep hoof-prints the water was
still oozing, while from others the trodden stems of
sedge were slowly struggling upright.</p>
<p>A smile of keen satisfaction passed over the
young woodsman&rsquo;s face at these signs. He prided
himself on his skill in trailing, and the primeval
predatory elation thrilled his nerves. At a swift
but easy lope he took up that clear trail, and followed
it back through the grass toward the woods.
It entered the woods not ten paces from the point
where the hunter himself had emerged, ran parallel
with the old wood-road for a dozen yards, and came
to a plain halt in the heart of a dense thicket of
hemlock. From the thicket it went off in great
leaps in a direction at right angles to the path.
There was not a breath of wind stirring, to carry a
scent. So the hunter realized that his intended victim
had been watching him from the thicket, and
that it was now a case of craft against craft. He
tightened his belt for a long chase, and set his lean
jaws doggedly as he resumed the trail.</p>
<p>The buck, who was wise with the wisdom of experience,
and apprised by the echoes of the first
gunshot of the fact that the truce was over, had
indeed been watching the hunter very sagaciously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
The moment he was satisfied that it was his trail
the hunter was following, he had set out at top
speed, anxious to get as far as possible from so
dangerous a neighbourhood. At first his fear grew
with his flight, so that his great, soft eyes stared
wildly and his nostrils dilated as he went bounding
over all obstacles. Then little by little the triumphant
exercise of his powers, and a realization of how
far his speed surpassed that of his pursuer, reassured
him somewhat. He decided to rest, and find
out what his foe was doing. He doubled back parallel
with his own trail for about fifty yards, then
lay down in a thicket to watch the enemy go by.</p>
<p>In an incredibly short time he did go by, at that
long, steady swing which ate up the distance so
amazingly. As soon as he was well past, the buck
sprang up and was off again at full speed, his heart
once more thumping with terror.</p>
<p>This time, however, instead of running straight
ahead, he made a wide, sweeping curve, tending
back toward the river and the lakes. As before,
only somewhat sooner, his alarm subsided and his
confidence, along with his curiosity, returned. He
repeated his former man&oelig;uvre of doubling back
a little way upon his trail, then again lay down to
wait for the passing of his foe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>When the hunter came to that first abrupt turn
of the trail he realized that it was a cunning and
experienced buck with which he had to deal. He
smiled confidently, however, feeling sure of his own
skill, and ran at full speed to the point where the
animal had lain down to watch him pass. From
this point he followed the trail just far enough to
catch its curve. Then he left it and ran in a straight
line shrewdly calculated to form the chord to his
quarry&rsquo;s section of a circle. His plan was to intercept
and pick up the trail again about three quarters
of a mile further on. In nine cases out of ten his
calculation would have worked out as he wished;
but in this case he had not made allowance for this
particular buck&rsquo;s individuality. While he imagined
his quarry to be yet far ahead, he ran past a leafy
clump of mingled Indian pear and thick spruce
seedlings. Half a minute later he heard a crash of
underbrush behind him. As he turned he caught
a tantalizing glimpse of tawny haunches vanishing
through the green, and he knew that once again
he had been outplayed.</p>
<p>This time the wise buck was distinctly more terrified
than before. The appearance of his enemy at
this unexpected point, so speedily, and not upon the
trail, struck a panic to his heart. Plainly, this was
no common foe, to be evaded by familiar stratagems.
His curiosity and his confidence disappeared
completely.</p>

&ldquo;RUNNING IN THE SHALLOW WATER TO COVER HIS SCENT&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>The buck set off in a straight line for the river,
now perhaps a half-mile distant. Reaching it, he
turned down the shore, running in the shallow
water to cover his scent. It never occurred to him
that his enemy was trailing him by sight, not by
scent; so he followed the same tactics he would
have employed had the pursuer been a wolf or a
dog. A hundred yards further on he rounded a
sharp bend of the stream. Here he took to deep
water, swam swiftly to the opposite shore, and vanished
into the thick woods.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later the man came out
upon the river&rsquo;s edge. The direction his quarry had
taken was plainly visible by the splashes of water on
the rocks, and he smiled grimly at the precaution
which the animal had taken to cover his secret.
But when he reached the point where the buck had
taken to deep water the smile faded. He stopped,
leaning on his gun and staring across the river,
and a baffled look came over his face. Realizing,
after a few moments, that he was beaten in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
game, he drew out his charge of buckshot, reloaded
his gun with small duckshot, and hid himself in a
waterside covert of young willows, in the hope that
a flock of mallard or teal might presently come by.</p>

<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">THE</span> attitude in which the plump baby
hung limply over the woman&rsquo;s left arm
looked most uncomfortable. The baby,
however, seemed highly content. Both his sticky
fists clutched firmly a generous &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; of new
maple-sugar, which he mumbled with his toothless
gums, while his big eyes, widening like an owl&rsquo;s,
stared about through the dusk with a placid intentness.</p>
</div>
<p>From the woman&rsquo;s left hand dangled an old tin
lantern containing a scrap of tallow candle, whose
meagre gleam flickered hither and thither apprehensively
among the huge shadows of the darkening
wood. In her right hand the woman carried
a large tin bucket, half filled with fresh-run maple-sap.
By the glimmer of the ineffectual candle, she
moved wearily from one great maple to another,
emptying the birch-bark cups that hung from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
little wooden taps driven into the trunks. The
night air was raw with the chill of thawing snow,
and carried no sound but the soft tinkle of the sap
as it dript swiftly into the birchen cups. The
faint, sweet smell of the sap seemed to cling upon
the darkness. The candle flared up for an instant,
revealing black, mysterious aisles among the ponderous
tree-trunks, then guttered down and almost
went out, the darkness seeming to swoop in upon
its defeat. The woman examined it, found that
it was all but done, and glanced nervously over her
shoulder. Then she made anxious haste to empty
and replace the last of the birchen cups before she
should be left in darkness to grope her way back
to the cabin.</p>
<p>The sap was running freely that spring, and the
promise of a great sugar-harvest was not to be ignored.
Dave Stone&rsquo;s house and farm lay about
three miles distant, across the valley of the &ldquo;Tin
Kittle,&rdquo; from the maple-clad ridge of forest wherein
he had his sugar-camp. The camp consisted of a
little cabin or &ldquo;shack&rdquo; of rough boards and an
open shed with a rude but spacious fireplace and
chimney to accommodate the great iron pot in
which the sap was boiled down into sugar. While
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
the sap was running freely, the pot had to be kept
boiling uniformly and the thickening sap kept
skimmed clean of the creaming scum; and therefore,
during the season, some one had to be always
living in the camp.</p>
<p>Dave Stone had built his camp at an opening
in the woods, in such a position that, from its own
little window in the rear, he could look out across
the wide valley of the &ldquo;Tin Kittle&rdquo; to a rigid
grove of firs behind which, shielded from the
nor&rsquo;easters, lay his low frame house, and red-doored
barn, and wide, liberal sheds. The distance
was only about three miles, or less, from
the house to the sugar-camp. But Dave Stone was
terribly proud of the prosperous little homestead
which he had carved for himself out of the unbroken
wilderness on the upper &ldquo;Tin Kittle,&rdquo; and
more than proud of the slim, gray-eyed wife and
three sturdy youngsters to whom that homestead
gave happy shelter. On the spring nights when
he had to stay over at the camp, he liked to be
able to see the grove that hid his home.</p>
<p>It chanced one afternoon, just in the height of
the sap-running, that Dave Stone was called suddenly
in to the settlement on a piece of business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
that could not wait overnight. A note which he
had endorsed for a friend had been allowed to go
to protest, and Dave was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; fer it, Mandy,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but fer ye to take the baby an&rsquo; go right over to
the camp fer the night, an&rsquo; keep an eye on this
bilin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; protested his wife, in a doubtful
voice, &ldquo;how kin I leave Lidy an&rsquo; Joe here alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to bother <i>them</i>,
an&rsquo; Lidy &rsquo;most ten year old!&rdquo; insisted Dave, who
was in a hurry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, mother. I&rsquo;ll be back
long afore mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the children had no objection to being left,
Mrs. Stone suffered herself to be persuaded. In
fact, she went to her new duty with a certain zest,
as a break in the monotony of her days. She had
lent a hand often enough at the sugar-making to
be familiar with the task awaiting her, and it was
with an unwonted gaiety that she set out on what
appeared to her almost in the light of a little
adventure.</p>
<p>But it was later than she had intended when she
actually got away, the baby crowing joyously on
her arm, and the children calling gay good-byes to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
her from the open door. Jake, the big brown retriever,
tried to follow her; and when she ordered
him back to stay with the children, he obeyed with
a whimpering reluctance that came near rebellion.
As she descended the valley, her feet sinking in the
snow of the thawing trail, she wondered why the
dog, which had always preferred the children,
should have grown so anxious to be with her.</p>
<p>When she reached the camp, she was already
tired, but the pleasant excitement was still upon
her. When she had skimmed the big, slow-bubbling
pot of syrup, tested a ladleful of it in the snow,
poured in some fresh sap, and replenished the sluggish
fire, dusk was already stealing upon the forest.
In her haste she did not notice that the candle in
the old lantern was almost burned out. Snatching
up the lantern, which it was not yet necessary to
light, and the big tin sap-bucket, and giving the
baby, who had begun to fret, a lump of hard sugar
to keep him quiet on her arm, she hurried off to
tend the farthest trees before the darkness should
close down upon the silences.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the last birch cup had been emptied into
the bucket, the candle flickered out; and for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
moment or two the sudden blackness seemed to
flap in her face, daunting her. She stood perfectly
still till her eyes readjusted themselves. She was
dead tired, the baby and the brimming bucket were
heavy, and the adventurous flavour had quite gone
out of her task.</p>
<p>In part because of her fatigue, she grew suddenly
timorous. Her ears began to listen with
terrible intentness till they imagined stealthy footsteps
in the silken shrinkings of the damp snow.
At last her eyes mastered the gloom till she could
make out the glimmering pathway, the dim, black
trunks shouldering up on either side of it, the
clumps of bushes obstructing it here and there.
Trembling&ndash;&ndash;clutching tightly at the baby, the lantern,
and the sap-bucket&ndash;&ndash;she started back with
furtive but hurried footsteps, afraid to make any
noise lest she attract the notice of some mysterious
powers of the wilderness.</p>
<p>As the woman went, her fears grew with her
haste till only the difficulties of the path, with the
weight of her burdens, prevented her from breaking
into a run of panic. The baby, meanwhile, kept
on sucking his maple-sugar and staring into the
novel darkness. The woman&rsquo;s breath began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
come too fast, her knees began to feel as if they
might turn to water at any moment. At last, when
within perhaps fifty paces of the shack, to her infinite
relief she saw a dark, tall figure take shape
just over the top of a bush, at the turn of the trail.
She had room for but one thought. It was Dave,
back earlier than he had expected. She did not stop
to wonder how or why. With a little, breathless
cry, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, Dave, I&rsquo;m so glad! Take
the baby!&rdquo; and reached forward to place the little
one in his arms.</p>
<p>Even as she did so, however, something in the
tall, dim shape rising over the bush struck her as
unfamiliar. And why didn&rsquo;t Dave speak? She
paused, she half drew back, while a chill fear made
her cheeks prickle; and as she slightly changed her
position, the dark form grew more definite. She
saw the massive bulk of the shoulders. She caught
a glint of white teeth, of fierce, wild eyes.</p>
<p>With a screech of intolerable horror, she shrank
back, clutching the baby to her bosom, swung the
brimming bucket of sap full into the monster&rsquo;s face,
and fled with the speed of a deer down another
trail toward the shack. She was at the door before
her appalled brain realized that the being to which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
she had tried to hand over the child was a huge
bear.</p>
<p>Bewildered and abashed for a few seconds by
the deluge of liquid and the clatter of the tin vessel
in his face, the animal had not instantly pursued.
But he was just out of the den after his long winter
sleep and savage with hunger. Moreover, he had
been allowed to realize that the dreaded man-creature
which he had met so unexpectedly was
afraid of him! He came crashing over the bushes,
and was so close at the woman&rsquo;s heels that she had
barely time to slam the shack door in his face.</p>
<p>As she dropped the rude wooden latch into place,
the woman realized with horror how frail the door
was. Momentarily she expected to see it smashed
in by a stroke of the monster&rsquo;s paw. She did not
know a bear&rsquo;s caution, his cunning suspicion of
traps, his dread of the scent of man.</p>
<p>There was no light in the shack, except a faint
red gleam from the open draft of the stove, and
the gray pallor of the night sky glimmering in
through the little window. The woman was so
faint with fear that she dared not search for the
candles, but leaned panting against the wall and
staring at the window as if she expected the bear
to look in at her. She was brought to her senses
in a moment, however, by the baby beginning to
cry. In the race for the shack, he had lost his
lump of sugar, and now he realized how uncomfortable
he was. The woman seated herself on
the bench by the stove and began to nurse him, all
the time keeping her eyes on the pale square of the
window.</p>

&ldquo;SNIFFED LOUDLY ALONG THE CRACK OF THE DOOR.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>When the door was slammed in his face, the bear
had backed away in apprehension and paused to
study the shack. But at the sound of the baby&rsquo;s
voice he seemed to realize that here, at least, were
some individuals of the dreaded man tribe who
were not dangerous. He came forward and sniffed
loudly along the crack of the door till the woman&rsquo;s
heart stood still. He leaned against it, tentatively,
till it creaked, but the latch and hinges held. Then
he prowled around the shack, examining it carefully,
and doubtless expecting to find an open entrance
somewhere. In his experience, all caves and
dens had entrances. At last the window caught
his attention. The woman heard the scratching
of his claws on the rough outer boarding as he
raised himself. Then the window was darkened
by a great black head looking in.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>Throwing the baby into the bunk, the woman
snatched from the stove a blazing stick, rushed to
the window with it, and made a wild thrust at the
dreadful face. With a crash the glass flew to splinters,
and the black face disappeared. The bear was
untouched, but the fiery weapon had taught him
discretion. He drew back with an angry growl,
and sat down on his haunches as if to see what
the woman would do next. She, for her part, after
this victory, grew terribly afraid of setting the dry
shack on fire; so she hurriedly returned the snapping,
sparkling brand to the stove. Thereupon the
bear resumed his ominous prowling, round and
round the shack, sometimes testing the foundations
and the door with massive but stealthy paw, sometimes
sniffing loudly at the cracks; and the woman
returned to the comforting of the baby.</p>
<p>In time the little one, fed full and cherished, went
to sleep. Then, with nothing left to occupy her
mind but the terrors of her situation, the woman
found those stealthy scratchings and sniffings, and
the strain of the silences that fell between, were
more than she could endure. At first, she thought
of getting a couple of blazing sticks, throwing open
the shack door, and deliberately attacking her
besieger. But this idea she dismissed as quite too
desperate and futile. Then she remembered that
bears were fond of sweets. A table in the corner
was heaped with great, round cakes of fragrant
sugar, the shape of the pans in which they had
been cooled. One of these she snatched up, and
threw it out of the window. The bear promptly
came around to see what had dropped, and fell
upon the offering with such ardour that it vanished
between his great jaws in half a minute. Then
he came straight to the window for more, and the
woman served it out to him without delay.</p>

&ldquo;MADE A WILD THRUST AT THE DREADFUL FACE.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>The beast&rsquo;s appetite for maple-sugar was amazing,
and as the woman saw the sweet store swiftly
disappearing, her fear began to be tempered with
indignation. But when her outraged frugality led
her to delay the dole, her tormentor came at the
window so savagely that she made all haste to supply
him, and fell to wondering helplessly what she
should do when the sugar was all gone.</p>
<p>As she stood at the window, watching fearfully
the vague, monstrous shape of the animal as he
pawed and gnawed at the last cake, suddenly, far
across the shadowy valley, a red light leaped into
the sky. For a moment the woman stared at it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
with an absent mind, absorbed in her own trouble,
yet noticing how black and sharp, like giant spears
upthrust in array, the tops of the firs stood out
against the glow. For a moment she stood so
staring. Then she realized where that wild light
came from. With a cry she turned, rushed to the
door, and tore it open. But as the dark of the
forest confronted her, she remembered! Slamming
and latching the door again, she rushed madly back
to the window, and stood there clutching the frame
with both hands, praying, and sobbing, and raving.</p>
<p>And the bear, having finished the sugar, sat up
on his haunches to gaze intently, ears cocked and
jaws half open, at that far-off, fiery brightness in
the sky of night.</p>
<p>As the keen tongues of flame shot over the treetops,
the woman clutched at her senses, and tried
to persuade herself that it was the barn, not the
house, that was burning. It was, in truth, quite
impossible to discern, at that distance, which it
was. It was not both; of that she was certain.
She also told herself that, if it <i>was</i> the house, it
was too early for the children to be asleep; and
even if they <i>were</i> asleep, Jake would wake them;
and presently some neighbours, who were not more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
than a mile away, would come to comfort their
fears and shelter them. She would not allow herself
to harbour the awful thought that the fire might
have caught the children in their sleep. Nevertheless,
do what she could to fight it away, the hideous
suggestion kept clamouring at her brain, driving
her to a frenzy. Had she been alone in this crisis,
the great beast watching and prowling outside the
shack would have had no terrors for her. But the
baby! She could not run fast with that burden.
She could not leave him behind in the bunk, for
the bear would either climb in the window or batter
in the door when she was gone. Yet to stand idle
and watch those leaping flames&ndash;&ndash;that way lay
madness. Again her mind reverted to the blazing
brand with which she had driven the bear from the
window. If she took one big enough and carried
it with her, the bear would probably not dare even
to follow her. She sprang eagerly to the stove, but
the fire was already dying down. It was nothing
but a heap of coals, and in her stress she had not
noticed how cold it had grown in the shack. She
looked for wood, but there was none. She had forgotten
to bring in an armful from the pile over by
the sugar-boiler. Well, the plan had been an insane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
one, hopeless from the first. But, at least, it had
been a plan. The failure of it seemed to leave her
tortured brain a blank. But the cold&ndash;&ndash;that was
an impression that pierced her despair. She went
to the bunk, and covered the sleeping baby with
warm blankets. As she leaned over him, she heard
the bear again, sniffing, sniffing along the crack at
the bottom of the door. She almost laughed&ndash;&ndash;that
the beast should want anything more after all
that sugar! Then she felt herself sinking, and
clutched at the edge of the bunk to save herself.
She would lie down by the baby! But instead of
that she sank upon the floor in a huddled heap.</p>
<p>Her swoon must have passed imperceptibly into
the heavy sleep of emotional exhaustion, for she
lay unstirring for some hours. The crying of the
little one awoke her.</p>
<p>Stiff, half frozen, utterly dazed, she pulled herself
up to the bunk, nursed the child, and soothed
him again to sleep. Then the accumulation of
anguish which had overwhelmed her rolled back
upon her understanding. She staggered to the
window.</p>
<p>The dreadful illumination across the valley had
died down to a faint ruddiness, just seen through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
the thin tops of the firs. The fire&ndash;&ndash;whether it had
been the barn or the house&ndash;&ndash;had burned itself out.
Whatever had happened, it was over. As she stood
shuddering, unable to think, not daring to think,
her eyes rested upon the bear, huge and formless
in the gloom, staring at her, not ten feet away.
She answered the stare fixedly, no longer aware of
fearing him. Then she saw him turn his head suddenly,
as if he had heard something. And the next
moment he had faded away swiftly and noiselessly
into the darkness, like a startled partridge. She
heard quick footsteps coming up the trail. A dog&rsquo;s
fierce growl broke into a bark of warning. That
was Jake&rsquo;s bark! She almost threw herself at the
door, and tore it open.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dave Stone had got back from the settlement
earlier than he expected, driving furiously the last
two miles of his journey, with his eyes full of the
red light of that burning, his heart gripped with
intolerable fear. He had found his good barn in
flames, but the children safe, the house untouched,
the stock rescued. The children, prompt and resourceful
as the children of the backwoods have
need to be, had loosed the cattle from the stanchions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
and got them out in time. Neighbours, hurrying up
in response to the flaming summons, had found the
children watching the blaze enthusiastically from
the doorstep, as if it had been arranged for their
amusement. Seeing matters so much better than
they might have been, Dave was struck with a new
apprehension, because Mandy had not returned. It
was hardly conceivable that she had failed to see
the flames from the window of the shack! Then
why had she not come? Followed by Jake, he had
taken the camp trail at a run to find out what was
the matter.</p>
<p>As he drew near the shack, the darkness of it
chilled him with dread. No firelight gleam showed
out from the window! And no red glow came
from the boiling-shed! The fire had been allowed
to die out under the sugar-pot! As the significance
of this dawned upon him, his keen woodsman&rsquo;s
eyes seemed to detect through the dark a shape of
thicker blackness gliding past the shack and into
the woods. At the same moment Jake growled,
barked shortly, and dashed past him, with the hair
bristling along his neck.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s blood went to ice, as he sprang to the
door of the shack, crying in a terrible voice:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
&ldquo;Mandy! Mandy! Where are&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But before
the question was out of his mouth, the door leaped
open, and Mandy was on his neck, shaking and
sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>they&rsquo;re</i> all right, mother!&rdquo; replied the
man cheerfully. &ldquo;It was only the barn&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; they
got the critters out all safe! But what&rsquo;s wrong
here? An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s kep&rsquo; you? An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was not allowed to finish his questionings,
for the woman was crying and laughing and strangling
him with her wild clasp. &ldquo;Oh, Dave!&rdquo; she
managed to exclaim. &ldquo;It was the bear&ndash;&ndash;as tried
to git us&ndash;&ndash;all night long! An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s et up every
crum of the last bilin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Return of the Moose</h2>
</div>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/Qt.png" title="" alt='"T' class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">TO</span> the best of my knowledge, ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t
been no moose seen this side the river
these eighteen year back.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The speaker, a heavy-shouldered, long-legged
backwoodsman, paused in his task of digging potatoes,
leaned on the handle of his broad-tined digging
fork, and bit off a liberal chew from his plug
of black tobacco. His companion, digging parallel
with him on the next row, paused sympathetically,
felt in his trousers&rsquo; pocket for his own plug of
&ldquo;black jack,&rdquo; and cast a contemplative eye up the
wide brown slope of the potato-field toward the
ragged and desolate line of burnt woods which
crested the hill.</p>
<p>The woods, a long array of erect, black, fire-scarred
rampikes, appeared to scrawl the very significance
of solitude against the lonely afternoon
sky. The austerity of the scene was merely heightened
by the yellow glow of a birch thicket at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
further upper corner of the potato-field, and by the
faint tints of violet light that flowed over the brown
soil from a pallid and fading sunset. As the sky
was scrawled by the gray-and-black rampikes, so
the slope was scrawled by zigzag lines of gray-and-black
snake fence, leading down to three log cabins,
with their cluster of log barns and sheds, scattered
irregularly along a terrace of the slope. A quarter
of a mile further down, beyond the little gray
dwellings, a sluggish river wound between alder
swamps and rough wild meadows.</p>
<p>As the second potato-digger was lifting his plug
of tobacco to his mouth, his hand stopped half way,
and his grizzled jaw dropped in astonishment. For
a couple of seconds he stared at the ragged hill-crest.
Then, it being contrary to his code to show
surprise, he bit off his chew, returned the tobacco
to his pocket, and coolly remarked: &ldquo;Well, I
reckon they&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the first
speaker, who had resumed his digging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be your moose, after these eighteen
year!&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>Standing out clear of the dead forest, and staring
curiously down upon the two potato-diggers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
were three moose,&ndash;&ndash;a magnificent, black, wide-antlered
bull, an ungainly brown cow, and a long-legged,
long-eared calf. A potato-field, with men
digging in it, was something far apart from their
experience and manifestly filled them with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still now, Sandy,&rdquo; muttered the first
speaker, who was wise in the ways of the wood-folk.
&ldquo;Keep still till they git used to us. Then
we&rsquo;ll go for our guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men stood motionless for a couple of minutes,
and the moose came further into the open in
order to get a better look at them. Then, leaving
their potato forks standing in their furrows, the
men strode quietly down the field, down the rocky
pasture lane, and into the nearest house. Here the
man called Sandy got down his gun,&ndash;&ndash;an old
muzzle-loading, single-barrelled musket,&ndash;&ndash;and hurriedly
loaded it with buckshot; while the other,
who was somewhat the more experienced hunter,
ran on to the next cabin and got his big Snider
rifle. The moose, meanwhile, having watched the
men fairly indoors, turned aside and fell to browsing
on the tiny poplar saplings which grew along
the top of the field.</p>

&ldquo;A MAGNIFICENT, BLACK, WIDE-ANTLERED BULL, AN UNGAINLY BROWN COW, AND A LONG-LEGGED, LONG-EARED CALF.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>Saying nothing to their people in the houses,
after the reticent backwoods fashion, Sandy and
Lije strolled carelessly down the road till the
potato-field was hidden from sight by a stretch of
young second-growth spruce and fir. Up through
this cover they ran eagerly, bending low, and
gained the forest of rampikes on top of the hill.
Here they circled widely, crouching in the coarse
weeds and dodging from trunk to trunk, until they
knew they were directly behind the potato-field.
Then they crept noiselessly outward toward the
spot where they had last seen the moose. The
wind was blowing softly into their faces, covering
their scent; and their dull gray homespun clothes
fitted the colour of the desolation around them.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that the big bull had changed
his mind, and wandered back among the rampikes,
leaving the cow and calf at their browsing among
the poplars. The woodsmen, therefore, came upon
him unexpectedly. Not thirty yards distant, he
stood eying them with disdainful curiosity, his
splendid antlers laid back while he thrust forward
his big, sensitive nose, trying to get the wind of
these mysterious strangers. There was menace in
his small, watchful eyes, and altogether his appearance
was so formidable that the hunters were just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
a trifle flurried, and fired too hastily. The big
bullet of Lije&rsquo;s Snider went wide, while a couple
of Sandy&rsquo;s buckshot did no more than furrow the
great beast&rsquo;s shoulder. The sudden pain and the
sudden monstrous noise filled him with rage, and,
with an ugly grunting roar, he charged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up a tree, Sandy!&rdquo; yelled Lije, setting the
example. But the bull was so close at his heels
that he could not carry his rifle with him. He
dropped it at the foot of the tree, and swung himself
up into the dead branches just in time to escape
the animal&rsquo;s rearing plunge.</p>
<p>Sandy, meanwhile, had found himself in serious
plight, there being no suitable refuge just at hand.
Those trees which were big enough had had no
branches spared by the fire. He had to run some
distance. Just as he was hesitating as to what he
should do, and looking for a rock or stump behind
which he might hide while he reloaded his gun, the
moose caught sight of him, forgot about Lije, and
came charging through the weeds. Sandy had no
more time for hesitation. He dropped his unwieldy
musket, and clambered into a blackened
and branchy hackmatack, so small that he feared
the rush of the bull might break it down. It did,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
indeed, crack ominously when the headlong bulk
reared upon it; but it stood. And Sandy felt as
if every branch he grasped were an eggshell.</p>
<p>Seeing that the bull&rsquo;s attention was so well occupied,
Lije slipped down the further side of his tree
and recaptured his Snider. He had by this time
entirely recovered his nerve, and now felt master
of the situation. Having slipped in a new cartridge
he stood forth boldly and waited for the moose to
offer him a fair target. As the animal moved this
way and that, he at length presented his flank. The
big Snider roared; and he dropped with a ball
through his heart, dead instantly. Sandy came
down from his little tree, and touched the huge
dark form and mighty antlers with admiring awe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the noise of the firing had
thrown the cow and calf into a panic. Since the
woods behind them were suddenly filled with such
thunders, they could not flee in that direction. But
far below them, down the brown slopes and past
the gray cabins, they saw the river gleaming among
its alder thickets. There was the shelter they
craved; and down the fields they ran, with long,
shambling, awkward strides that took them over
the ground at a tremendous pace. At the foot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the field they blundered into the lane leading down
to Sandy&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>Now, as luck would have it, Sandy had that
summer decided to build himself a frame house
to supplant the old log cabin. As a preliminary,
he had dug a spacious cellar, just at the foot of
the lane. It was deep as well as wide, being intended
for the storage of many potatoes. And, in
order to prevent any of the cattle from falling into
it, he had surrounded it with a low fence which
chanced to be screened along the upper side with
a rank growth of burdock and other barnyard
weeds.</p>
<p>When the moose cow reached this fence, she
hardly noticed it. She was used to striding over
obstacles. Just now her heart was mad with panic,
and her eyes full of the gleam of the river she
was seeking. She cleared the fence without an
effort&ndash;&ndash;and went crashing to the bottom of the
cellar. Not three paces behind her came the calf.</p>
<p>By this time, of course, all the little settlement
was out, and the flight of the cow and calf down
the field had been followed with eager eyes. Everyone
ran at once to the cellar. The unfortunate cow
was seen to have injured herself so terribly by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
plunge that, without waiting for the owner of the
cellar to return, the young farmer from the third
cabin jumped down and ended her suffering with
a butcher knife. The calf, however, was unhurt.
He stood staring stupidly at his dead mother and
showed no fear of the people that came up to stroke
and admire him. He seemed so absolutely docile
that when Sandy and Lije came proudly down the
hill to tell of their achievement, Sandy declared
that the youngster should be kept and made a
pet of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he said to Lije, &ldquo;that seein&rsquo; as
the moose had been so long away, we hain&rsquo;t treated
them jest right when they come back. I feel like
we&rsquo;d ought to make it up to the little feller.&rdquo;</p>

To-day, feeling the need of saltier fare, she led him
in the opposite direction, down through a cleft in
the cliffs, and out across the great, red, glistening
mud-flats left bare by the ebb of the terrific Fundy
tides.</p>
</div>
<p>From the secure warmth of his den the cub had
heard, faint and far off, the waves thundering along
the bases of the cliffs, when the tide was high and
the great winds drew heavily in from sea. The
sound had always made him afraid; and to-day,
though there was no wind, and the tide was so
far out that it made no noise but a soft whisper,
silken and persuasive, he held back with babyish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
timidity, till his mother brought him to his senses
with an unceremonious cuff on the side of the
head. With a squall of grieved surprise he picked
himself up, shaking his head as if he had a bee in
his ear, and then made haste to follow obediently,
close at his mother&rsquo;s huge black heels.</p>
<p>From the break in the cliffs, where the bears
came down, ran a ledge of shelving rocks on a
long, gradual slant across the flats toward the edge
of low water. The tide was nearing the last of the
ebb; and now, the slope of the shore being very
gradual, and the difference between high and low
water in these turbulent channels something between
forty and fifty feet, the lapsing fringes of
the ebb, yellow-tawny with silt, were a good three-quarters
of a mile away from the foot of the cliffs.
The vast spaces between were smooth, oily, copper-red
mud, shining and treacherous in the sun with
the narrow black outcrop of the ledge drawn across
on so gentle a slant that before it reached the water
it was running almost on a parallel with the shoreline.</p>
<p>Along the rocky ledge the old bear led the way,
pausing to nose at a patch of seaweed here and
there or to glance shrewdly into the shallow pools
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
among the rocks. The cub obediently followed her
example, though doubtless with no idea of what
he might hope to find. But the upper stretches of
the ledge, near high-water mark, offered nothing
to reward their quest, having been dry for several
hours, and long ago thoroughly gone over
by earlier foragers. So the bears pushed on down
toward the lower stretches, where the ledges were
still wet, and the long, black-green weed-masses
still dripping, and where the limpet-covered protuberances
of rock still oozed and sparkled. With
her iron-hard claws the mother bear scraped off
a quantity of these limpets, and crushed them between
her jaws with relish, swallowing the salty
juices. The cub tried clumsily to imitate her, but
the limpets defied his too tender claws, so he ran
to his mother, thrust her great head aside, and
greedily licked up a share of her scrapings. The
sea flavour tickled his palate, but the rough, hard
shells exasperated him. They hurt his gums, so
that he merely rolled them over in his mouth,
sucked at them a few moments, then spat them
out indignantly. His mother thereupon forsook
the unsatisfactory limpets, and went prowling on
toward the water&rsquo;s edge in search of more satisfying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
fare. As they left the limpets, a gaunt figure
in gray homespuns, carrying a rifle, appeared on
the crest of the cliffs above, caught sight of them,
and hurriedly took cover behind an overhanging
pine.</p>
<p>The young woodsman&rsquo;s first impulse was to try
a long shot at the hulking black shape so conspicuous
out on the ledge, against the bright water. He
wanted a bearskin, even if the fur was not just
then in prime condition. But more particularly
he wanted the cub, to tame and play with if it
should prove amenable, and to sell, ultimately, for
a good amount, to some travelling show. On consideration,
he decided to lie in wait among the rocks
till the rising tide should drive the bears back to
the upland. He exchanged his steel-nosed cartridges
for the more deadly mushroom-tipped, filled
his pipe, and lay back comfortably against the pine
trunk, to watch, through the thin green frondage,
the foraging of his intended prey.</p>
<p>The farther they went down the long slant of
the ledge, the more interested the bears became.
Here the crows and gulls had not had time to capture
all the prizes. There were savoury blue-shelled
mussels clinging under the tips of the rocks; plump,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
spiral whelks between the oozy tresses of the seaweed;
orange starfish and bristly sea-urchins in the
shallow pools. All these dainties had shells that
the cub&rsquo;s young teeth could easily crush, and they
yielded meaty morsels that made beetles and grubs
seem very meagre fare. Moreover, in the salty
bitter of this sea-fruit there was something marvelously
stimulating to the appetite. From pool
to pool the old bear wandered on, lured ever by
richer prizes just ahead; and the cub, stuffed till
his little stomach was like a black furry ball, no
longer frisked and tumbled, but waddled along beside
her with eyes of shining expectancy. As long
as he was not too full to walk, he was not too full
to eat such delicacies as these. The fascinating
quest led them on and on till at last they found
themselves at the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>By this time they had travelled a long way from
the cleft in the cliffs by which they had come down
from the uplands. A good half-mile of shining
mud separated them, in a direct line, from the cliff
base. And the woodsman on the height, as he
watched them, muttered to himself: &ldquo;Ef that old
b&rsquo;ar don&rsquo;t look out, the tide&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to ketch her
afore she knows what she&rsquo;s about! Most wish I&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
&rsquo;a&rsquo; socked it to her afore she&rsquo;d got so fur out&ndash;&ndash;Jiminy!
She&rsquo;s seed her mistake now! The tide&rsquo;s
turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While bear and cub had their noses and paws
busy in a little dry pool, on a sudden a long, shallow,
muddy-crested wave had come hissing up over
their feet and filled the pool to the brim with its
yellow flood. Lifting her head sharply, the old
bear glanced at the far-off cliffs, and at the mounting
tide. Instantly realizing the peril, she started
back at a slow, lumbering amble up the long, long
path by which they had come; and the cub started
too at a brave gallop&ndash;&ndash;not behind her, for he was
too much afraid of the hissing yellow wave, but
close at her side, between her sheltering form and
the shore. He felt that she could in some way
ward off or subdue the cold and terrifying monster.</p>
<p>For perhaps two minutes the cub struggled on
gamely, although, owing to the fact that at this
point their path was almost parallel with the water,
the fugitives made no perceptible gain, and the rising
wave was on their heels every instant. Then
the greedy feeding produced its effect. The little
fellow&rsquo;s wind gave out completely. With a whimper
of pain and fright he dropped back upon his
haunches and waited for his mother to save him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>The old bear turned, bounced back, and cuffed
him so bruskly that he found breath enough to
utter a loud squall and go stumbling forward for
another score of yards. Then he gave out, and
sank upon his too-distended stomach, whimpering
piteously.</p>
<p>This time the mother seemed to perceive that
his case was serious, and her anxious wrath subsided.
She licked him assiduously for a few seconds,
whining encouragement, till at last he got
upon his feet again, trembling. The yellow flood
was now lapping on the ledge all about them.
But a rod or two farther on the rocks bulged up
a couple of feet above the surrounding slope.
Thrusting the exhausted youngster ahead of her
with nose and paws, the old bear gained this
point of temporary vantage; and then, worried and
frightened, sat down upon her haunches and stared
all around her, as if trying to decide what should
be done. The cub lay flat, with legs outstretched
and mouth wide open, panting.</p>
<p>The tide, meanwhile, was mounting so swiftly
that in a few moments the rise of rocks had become
almost an island. The ledge was covered
before them as well as behind, and the only way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
still open lay straight over the glistening mud.
The old bear looked at it, and whined, knowing
its treacheries. And the woodsman, watching with
eager interest from the cliffs, muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take to it, ye old bug-eater! Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nawthin&rsquo;
else left fer ye to do&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was apparently the conclusion of the old
bear herself; for now, after licking and nuzzling
the cub for a few seconds till he stood up, she
stepped boldly off the rock and started out over
the coppery flats. The cub, having apparently
recovered his wind, followed briskly&ndash;&ndash;probably
much heartened by the fact that his progress was
in a direction away from the alarming waves.</p>
<p>There was desperate need of haste, for when
they left the rocky lift the tide was already slipping
around upon the flats beyond it. Nevertheless,
the old bear moved with deliberation. She
could not hurry the cub; and she had to choose
her path. By some instinct, or else by some peculiar
keenness of observation, she seemed to detect the
&ldquo;honey-pots,&rdquo; or deep pockets of slime, that lay
concealed beneath the uniformly shining surface
of the mud; for here she would make an aimless
detour, losing many precious seconds, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
she would side-step suddenly, for several paces, and
shift her course to a new parallel. Outside the
&ldquo;honey-pots,&rdquo; the mud was soft and tenacious to
a depth varying from a few inches to a couple of
feet, but with a hard clay foundation beneath the
slime. Through this clinging red ooze the old
bear, with her huge strength, made her way without
difficulty; but the cub, in a few moments, began
to find himself terribly hampered. His fur
collected the mud. His little paws sank easily,
but at each step it grew harder to withdraw them.
At last, chancing to stagger aside from his mother&rsquo;s
spacious tracks, he sank to his belly in the rim of a
&ldquo;honey-pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panic-stricken, he floundered vainly, his nose
high in the air and his eyes shut tight, while his
mother, unconscious of what had happened,
ploughed doggedly onward. Presently he opened
his eyes. His mother was now perhaps ten or a
dozen feet ahead, apparently deserting him. Right
behind, lapping up to his very tail, was the crawling
wave. A heart-broken bawl burst from his
throat.</p>
<p>At that cry the old bear came dashing back, red
mud half-way up her flanks and plastered all over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
her shaggy chest. Taking in the situation at a
glance, she seized the cub by the nape of the neck
with her teeth, and tried to drag him free. But
he squealed so lamentably that she realized that
the hide would yield before the mud would. The
attempt had taken time, however; and the tide was
now well up in the fur of his back. Thrusting her
paw down beneath his haunches, she tore him clear
with a mighty wrench and a loud sucking of the
baffled mud. That stroke sent him head over heels
some ten feet nearer safety. By the time he had
picked himself up, pawing fretfully at the mud that
bedaubed his face and half blinded him, his mother
was close behind him, nosing him along and lifting
him forward skilfully with her fore paws.</p>
<p>The slope of the flats was now so gradual as to
be almost imperceptible; and the tide, therefore,
seemed to be racing in with fiercer haste, as if in
wrath at being so long balked of its prey. Engrossed
in her efforts to push the cub forward,
the mother now lost some of her fine discrimination
in regard to &ldquo;honey-pots.&rdquo; She pushed the cub
straight into one; but jerked him back unceremoniously
before the mud had time to get any grip
upon him. Pausing for a moment to scrutinize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
the oozy expanse, she thrust the little animal furiously
along to the left, searching for a safe passage.
Before she could find one, however, the tide
was upon them, their feet splashing in the thin
yellow wavelets.</p>
<p>A broken soap-box, tossed overboard from some
ship, came washing up, and stranded just before
them. With a whimper of delight, as if he thought
the box a safe refuge, the cub scrambled upon it;
but his mother ruthlessly tumbled him off and hustled
him onward, floundering and splashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hev to swim fer it, Old Woman!&rdquo;
growled the now excited watcher behind the pine-tree
on the cliff.</p>
<p>As the creeping flood by this time overspread
the ooze for a couple of yards ahead of them, the
mother could no longer discriminate as to what
lay beneath it. She could do nothing now but dash
ahead blindly. Catching up the cub between her
jaws, in a grip that made him squeal, she launched
herself straight toward shore, hardly daring to let
her feet rest an instant where they touched. Fortune
favoured her in this rush. She got ahead of
the tide. She gained upon it, perhaps twice her
body&rsquo;s length. Then she paused, to drop the cub.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
But the pause was fatal. She began to sink instantly.
She had come upon a &ldquo;honey-pot&rdquo; of
stiffer consistency than the rest, which had sustained
her while she was in swift motion, but now,
in return for that support, clutched her in a grip
the more inexorable. With all her huge strength
she strained to wrench herself clear. But in vain.
She had no purchase. There was nothing to put
forth her strength upon. In her terror and despair
she squealed aloud, with her snout high in
air as if appealing to the blank, blue, empty sky.
The cub, terror-stricken, strove to clamber upon
her back.</p>
<p>That harsh cry of hers, however, was but the
outburst of one moment&rsquo;s weakness. The next
moment the indomitable old bear was striving
silently and systematically to release herself. She
would wrench one great fore arm clear, lift it high,
and feel about for a solid foundation beneath the
ooze. Failing in this, she would yield that paw to
the enemy again, tear the other loose, and feel
about for a foothold in another direction. At the
same time she drew out her body to its full length,
and lay flat, so that she might gain as much support
as possible by distributing her weight. Because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
of this sagacity, and because the mire at this
point had more substance than in most of the other
&ldquo;honey-pots,&rdquo; she made a good fight, and almost,
but not quite, held her own. By the time the tide
had once more overtaken her she had sunk but a
little way, and was still far from giving up the
unequal struggle.</p>
<p>Yet for all the great beast&rsquo;s strength, and valour,
and devotion, there could have been but one end
to that brave battle, and mother and cub would
have disappeared, in a few minutes more, under
the stealthy, whispering onrush of the flood, had
not the whimsical Providence&ndash;&ndash;or Hazard&ndash;&ndash;of
the Wild come curiously to their aid. Among the
jetsam of those restless Fundy tides almost anything
that will float may appear, from a matchbox
to a barn. What appeared just now was a big
spruce log, escaped from the boom on some river
emptying into the bay. It came softly wallowing in,
lipped by the little waves, and passed close by the
nose of the old bear, where she struggled with the
water up to her shoulders.</p>

&ldquo;PULLED THE BUTT UNDER HER CHEST.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>Quick as thought she flashed up a heavy paw,
caught the log by one end, and pulled the butt under
her chest. The purchase thus gained enabled her
to free the other paw&ndash;&ndash;and in a few seconds more
the weight of the fore part of her body was on the
end of the log, forcing it down to the mud. Greedy
as that mud was, it was yet incapable of engulfing
a full-grown spruce timber quickly enough to defeat
the bear&rsquo;s purpose. Stretching far forward
on the submerged log, she strained her muscles to
their utmost, and slowly drew her hind quarters
free from the deadly grip that held them. Then,
seizing in her jaws the cub, which was swimming
and whimpering beside her, she carefully felt her
way farther along the log, and sat down upon it
to rest, clutching the youngster closely in one great
fore arm.</p>
<p>Not till the tide had risen nearly to her neck did
the mother move again. She was recovering her
strength. Utterly daunted by the peril of the
&ldquo;honey-pots,&rdquo; she chose rather to trust the tide
itself. At last, catching the cub again by the back
of the neck, she swam for the shore. The tide was
now within a couple of hundred yards from the
bases of the cliffs, and lapping upon solid, sun-baked
clay. The strong flood helping her, she
swam fast, though laboriously by reason of the
burden in her teeth. Soon her hinder feet struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
ground&ndash;&ndash;but she was afraid to trust it, and nervously
drew them up beneath her. A few moments
more and she felt undeniably firm footing; whereupon
she plunged forward with a rush, and never
paused, even to drop the squirming cub, till she
was above high-water mark.</p>
<p>When, at last, she set the little beast down, she
was in such a hurry to get away from the shore
and back into the secure green woods that she
would not trust him to follow her, as usual, but
drove him on ahead, as fast as he could move,
toward the cleft in the cliffs. As they turned up
the rugged trail her haste relaxed, and she went
more slowly, but still driving the cub ahead of her,
that she might be quite sure that the &ldquo;honey-pots&rdquo;
would not reach up and clutch at him again.</p>
<p>As the muddy, weary, bedraggled, pathetic-looking
pair passed within tempting range of the pine-tree
on the cliff-top, the woodsman instinctively
threw forward his rifle. But the next moment he
dropped it, with a slight flush, and gave a quick
glance around him as if he feared that unseen eyes
might have taken note of the gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been no better&rsquo;n
a <i>murderer</i>, &rsquo;f I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone an&rsquo; plugged the Old
Girl <i>now</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Fight at the Wallow</h2>
</div>
<h3>I</h3>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/F.png" title="" alt="F" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">FAR</span> to the northeast of Ringwaak Hill,
just beyond that deep, far-rimmed lake
which begets the torrent of the Ottanoonsis,
rise the bluff twin summits of Old Walquitch,
presiding over an unbroken and almost
untrodden wilderness. Some way up the southeasterly
flank of the loftier and more butting
of the twin peaks ran a vast, open shelf, or terrace,
a kind of barren, whose swampy but austere soil
bore no growth but wiry bush. The green tips
of this bushy growth were a favoured &ldquo;browse&rdquo;
of the caribou, who, though no lovers of the
heights, would often wander up from their shaggy
and austere plains in quest of this aromatic forage.
But this lofty mountainside barren had yet another
attraction for the caribou. Close at its edge, just
where a granite buttress fell away steeply toward
the lake, a tiny, almost imperceptible spring, stained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
with iron and pungent with salt, trickled out from
among the roots of a dense, low thicket. Past the
bare spot made by these oozings, and round behind
the thicket, led a dim trail, worn by the feet of
caribou, moose, bear, deer, and other stealthy wayfarers.
And to this spring, when the moon of the
falling leaves brought in the season of love and
war, the caribou bulls were wont to come, delighting
to form their wallow in the pungent, salty mud.</p>
</div>
<p>The bald twin peaks of Old Walquitch were
ghostly white in the flood of the full moon, just
risen, and swimming like a globe of witch&rsquo;s fire
over the far, dark, wooded horizon. But the bushy
shelf and the spring by the thicket, were still in
shadow. Along the trail to the spring, moving
noiselessly, yet with a confident dignity, came a
paler shadow, the shape of a huge, gray-white
caribou bull with wide-spreading antlers.</p>
<p>At the edge of the spring the bull stopped and
began sniffing the sharp-scented mud. Apparently
he found no sign of a rival having passed that way
before him, or of a cow having kept tryst there.
Lifting his splendid head he stared all about him
in the shadow, and up at the bare, illuminated
fronts of the twin peaks.</p>

&ldquo;HE &lsquo;BELLED&rsquo; HARSHLY SEVERAL TIMES ACROSS THE DARK WASTES.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>As the light spread down the mountain to the
edge of the shelf, and the moon rose into his view,
he &ldquo;belled&rdquo; harshly several times across the dark
wastes outspread below him.</p>
<p>Receiving no answer to his defiance, the great
bull turned his attention again to the ooze around
the spring. After sniffing it all over he fell to
furrowing it excitedly with the two lowermost
branches of his antlers,&ndash;&ndash;short, broad, palmated
projections thrust out low over his forehead, and
called by woodsmen &ldquo;the ploughs.&rdquo; Every few
seconds he would toss his head fiercely, like an
ordinary bull, and throw the ooze over his shoulders.
Then he pawed the cool, strong-smelling
stuff to what he seemed to consider a fitting consistency,
sniffed it over again, and raised his head
to &ldquo;bell&rdquo; a fresh challenge across the spacious
solitudes. Receiving no answer, he snorted in disgust,
flung himself down on the trampled ooze, and
began to wallow with a sort of slow and intense
vehemence, grunting massively from time to time
with volcanic emotion.</p>
<p>The wallow was now in the full flood of the
moonlight. In that mysterious illumination the
caribou, encased in shining ooze, took on the grotesque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and enormous aspect of some monster of
the prediluvian slimes. Suddenly his wallowing
stopped, and his antlers, dripping mud, were lifted
erect. For a few moments he was motionless as
a rock, listening. He had caught the snapping of
a twig, in the trail below the edge of the shelf.
The sound was repeated; and he understood.
Blowing smartly, as if to clear the mud from about
his nostrils, he lurched to his feet, stalked forth
from the wallow, and stood staring arrogantly
along the trail by which he had come. The next
moment another pair of antlers appeared; and then
another bull, tall but lean, and with long, spiky,
narrow horns, mounted over the edge of the shelf,
and halted to eye the apparition before him.</p>
<p>The newcomer was of a darker hue than the
lord of the wallow, and of much slimmer build,&ndash;&ndash;altogether
less formidable in appearance. But he
looked very fit and fearless as, after a moment&rsquo;s
supercilious survey of his rival&rsquo;s ooze-dripping
form, he came mincing forward to the attack. The
two, probably, had never seen each other before;
but in rutting season all caribou bulls are enemies
at sight.</p>
<p>The white bull&ndash;&ndash;no longer white now, but black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
and silver in the moonlight&ndash;&ndash;stood for some seconds
quite motionless, his head low, his broad and
massive antlers thrust forward, his feet planted
firmly and apart. Ominous in his stillness, he
waited till his light-stepping and debonair adversary
was within twenty feet of him. Then, with
an explosive blowing through his nostrils, he
launched himself forward to the attack.</p>
<p>Following the customary tactics of his kind, the
second bull lowered his antlers to receive the
charge. But in the last fraction of a breath before
the crash, he changed his mind. Leaping aside
with a lightning alertness more like the action of
a red buck than that of a caribou, he just evaded
the shock. At the same time two of the spiky
prongs of one antler ripped a long gash down his
opponent&rsquo;s flank.</p>
<p>Amazed at this departure from the usual caribou
tactics, and smarting with the anguish of that punishing
stroke, the white bull whirled in his tracks,
and charged again, blind with fury. The slim
stranger had already turned, and awaited him
again, with lowered antlers in readiness, close by
the edge of the wallow. This time he seemed
determined to meet the shock squarely according
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
to the rules of the game&ndash;&ndash;which apparently demand
that the prowess of a caribou bull shall be
determined by his pushing power. But again he
avoided, leaping aside as if on springs; and again
his sharp prongs furrowed his enemy&rsquo;s flank.
With a grunt of rage the latter plunged on into
the wallow, where he slipped forward upon his
knees.</p>
<p>Had the newcomer been a little more resourceful
he might now have taken his adversary at a terrible
disadvantage, and won an easy victory. But he
hesitated, being too much enamoured of his own
method of fighting; and in the moment of hesitation
opportunity passed him by. The white bull,
recovering himself with suddenly awakened agility,
was on his feet and on guard again in an instant.</p>
<p>These two disastrous experiences, however, had
added wariness and wisdom to the great bull&rsquo;s fighting
rage. His wound, his momentary discomfiture,
had opened his arrogant eyes to the fact that his
antagonist was a dangerous one. He stood vigilant
and considering for a few seconds, no longer with
his feet planted massively for a resistless rush, but
balanced, and all his forces gathered well in hand;
while his elusive foe stepped lightly and tauntingly
from side to side before him, threateningly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>When the white bull made up his mind to attack
again, instead of charging madly to swab his foe
off the earth, he moved forward at a brisk stride,
ready to check himself on the instant and block the
enemy&rsquo;s side stroke. Within a couple of yards of
his opponent he stopped short. The latter stood
motionless, antlers lowered as before, apparently
quite willing to lock horns. But the white bull
would not be lured into a rush. Fiercely impatient
he stamped the ground with a broad, clacking forehoof.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, as if in response to the
challenge of the hoof, the stranger charged like
lightning. But almost in the same motion he
swerved aside, seeking again to catch his adversary
on the flank. Swift and cunning as he was, however,
the white bull was this time all readiness.
He whirled, head down. With a sharp, dry crash
the two sets of antlers came together, and locked.</p>
<p>That this should have happened was the irremediable
mistake of the slim stranger. In that
close encounter, fury against fury, force against
force fairly pitted, his speed and his agility counted
for nothing. For a few seconds, indeed, in sheer
desperation he succeeded in withstanding his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
heavier and more powerful foe. With hind feet
braced far back, haunches strained, flank heaving
and quivering, the two held steady, staccato grunts
and snorts attesting the ferocity of their efforts.
Then the hind foot of the younger bull slipped a
little. With a convulsive wrench he recovered his
footing; and again the struggle hung at poise. But
it was only for a few moments. Suddenly, as if
he had felt his opportunity approach, the white bull
threw all his strength into a mightier thrust. The
legs of his adversary seemed to crumple up like
paper beneath him.</p>
<p>This would have been the end of the young bull&rsquo;s
battlings and wooings; but as his good luck would
have it, it was at the very edge of the shelf that
he collapsed. Disengaging his victorious antlers,
the conqueror thrust viciously and evisceratingly at
the victim&rsquo;s exposed flank. The latter was just
struggling to rise, with precarious foothold on the
loose-turfed brink of the steep. As he writhed
away wildly from the goring points, the bushes and
turf crumbled away, and he fell backwards, rolling
and crashing till he brought up, battered but whole,
in a sturdy thicket of young firs. Regaining his
feet he slunk off hurriedly into the dark of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
woods. And the victor, standing on the brink in
the white glare of the moonlight, &ldquo;belled&rdquo; his
triumph hoarsely across the solemn spaces of the
night.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>A sound of footfalls, hesitating but apparently
making no attempt at concealment, came from
the bend of the trail beyond the wallow; and the
great white bull wheeled savagely to see what was
approaching. As he glared, however, the angry
ridge of hair cresting his neck sank amiably. A
young cow, attracted by his calls and the noise
of the battle, was coming around the thicket.</p>
<p>At the edge of the thicket, not a dozen paces
from the black ooze-bed of the wallow, the cow
paused coyly, as if doubtful of her welcome. She
murmured in her throat, a sort of rough allurement
which seemed to the white bull&rsquo;s ears extraordinarily
enticing. He answered, very softly,
and stepped forward a pace or two, inviting rather
than pursuing. Reassured, the young cow advanced
confidently and eagerly to meet him.</p>
<p>At this moment, out from the heart of the thicket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
plunged a towering black form, with wide, snarling
jaw&rsquo;s agleam in the moonlight. It seemed to launch
itself through the air, as if from a height. One
great, taloned paw struck the young cow full on the
neck, a crashing blow, shattering the vertebrae
through all their armour of muscle. With a groan
the stricken cow sank down, her outstretched muzzle
smothered in the ooze of the wallow; and the
monstrous bulk of the bear fell upon her, tearing
the warm flesh hungrily.</p>
<p>In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the most
hot-headed and powerful bull of the caribou will
shrink from trying conclusions with a full grown
black bear. The duel, as a rule, is too cruelly one-sided.
The bear, on the other hand, knows that
a courageous bull is no easy victim; and the monster
ambuscaded in the thicket had been waiting
for one or both of the rivals to be disabled before
making his attack. The approach of the young
cow had been an unexpected favour of the Powers
that order the wilderness; and in clutching his opportunity
he had scornfully and absolutely put the
white bull out of the reckoning.</p>
<p>But this bull was the exceptional one, the one
that confounds generalizations, and confirms the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
final supremacy of the unexpected. He was altogether
fearless, indifferent to odds, and just now
flushed with overwhelming victory. Moreover, he
was aflame with mating ardour; and the mate of
his desire had just been brutally struck down before
his eyes. For a moment or two he stood
bewildered, not daunted, but amazed by the terrific
apparition and the appalling event. Then a mad
fire raged through all his veins, his great muscles
swelled, the stiff hair on his neck and shoulders
stood straight up, his eyes went crimson&ndash;&ndash;and
without a sound he charged across the wallow.</p>
<p>When the bulls of the caribou kin fight each
other, the weapons of their sole dependence are
their antlers. But when they fight alien enemies
they are wont to hold their heads high and strike
with the battering, knife-edged weapons of their
fore-hoofs. The bear, crouched upon his quivering
prey, was too absorbed and too scornful to look
for any assault. The bull was upon him, therefore,
before he had time to guard his exposed flank.
From the corner of his eye, he saw a big glistening
shape which reared suddenly above him, and, clever
boxer that he was, he threw up a ponderous forearm
to parry the blow. But he was too late. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
all the force of some seven hundred pounds of rage,
avenging rage, behind him, these great hoofs, with
their cutting edges, came down upon his side,
smashing in several ribs, and gashing a wide
wound down into his loins. The shock was so
terrific that his own counter stroke, usually so
swift and unerring, went wild altogether, and he
was sent rolling clear of the body of his prey.</p>
<p>Instantly upon delivering his stroke, the white
bull had pranced lightly aside, knowing well enough
the swift and deadly effectiveness of a bear&rsquo;s paw.
But he struck yet again, almost, it seemed, in the
same breath, and just as the bear was struggling
up upon his haunches. Frantically, out of his astonishment,
fury, and pain, the bear attempted to
guard. He succeeded, indeed, in warding off those
deadly hoofs from his flank; but he caught an
almost disabling blow on the point of the left
shoulder, putting his left forearm out of business.
With a squawling grunt he swung about upon his
haunches, bringing his right toward the enemy, and
sat up, savagely but anxiously defensive.</p>
<p>Sore wounded though he was, the bear was not
yet beaten. One fair buffet of his right paw, could
he but land it in the proper place,&ndash;&ndash;on nose, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
neck, or leg&ndash;&ndash;might yet give him the victory, and
let him crawl off to nurse his hurts in some dense
covert, leaving his broken foe to die in the wallow.
But the white bull, though he had underrated his
former antagonist, was in no danger of misprizing
this one. He was now as wary as he had, in the
previous case, been rash. Moreover, he had had a
dreadful object lesson in the power of the bear&rsquo;s
paw. The body of the cow before him kept him
from forgetting.</p>
<p>Stepping restlessly from side to side, threatening
now with hoof and now with antlers, he seemed
each instant upon the point of a fresh attack; and
the bear, with swaying muzzle and blazing, shifting
eyes, kept following his every motion. Again and
again he gathered his muscles for a fresh charge&ndash;&ndash;but
each time he checked himself with a realization
that the body of the slain cow was exactly in his
way, hampering his avoidance of a counter-stroke.</p>
<p>After some minutes of this feinting, the caribou
stood still, deliberating some new move. Instantly
the bear, also, became motionless as a stone. The
sudden peace was like a shock of enchantment, a
violent sorcery, and over it the blue-white, flooding
shine of the moonlight seemed to take on some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
sinister significance. The seconds lengthened out
as a nightmare, till at last the stupendous stillness
was broken by the wild clamour of a loon, far down
on the lake. As the distant cry shrilled up the
mountainside, the white bull stirred, shook his
antlers, and blew loudly through his nostril. It
was a note of challenge&ndash;&ndash;but in it the bear divined
a growing hesitancy. Perhaps, after all, this fight,
which had gone so sorely against him, might not
have to be fought out! He dropped, whirled about
so quietly one could hardly follow the motion&ndash;&ndash;and
in a flash was up again on his haunches, right
paw uplifted, eyes blazing vigilant defiance. But
he had retreated several feet in that swift man&oelig;uvre!
His move was a confusion of defeat&ndash;&ndash;but
his attitude was a warning that he was dangerous
in defeat. The bull followed, but only for
a couple of steps, which brought him so that he
bestrode the body of the cow. Here he halted, still
threatening; and again the two confronted each
other motionlessly.</p>
<p>This time, however, the spell was broken by the
bear himself. Suddenly he repeated his former
man&oelig;uvre; and again turned to face his adversary.
But the bull did not follow. Without a movement
he stood, as if content with his victory. And after
a few moments the bear, as if realizing that the
fight was over, flung himself aside from the trail
and went limping off painfully through the bushes,
keeping a watchful eye over his shoulder till he
vanished into a bunch of dense spruce against the
mountainside.</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>The white bull eyed his going proudly. Then
he looked down at the torn and lifeless body between
his feet. He had not really taken note of
it before. Now he bent his head and sniffed at
it with wondering interrogation. The spreading
blood, still warm, smote his nostrils; and all at
once, it seemed, death and the fear of death were
borne in upon his arrogant heart. He tossed his
head, snorting wildly, flung himself clear of the
uncomprehended, dreadful thing upon the ground,
bounded over the wallow as if it, too, had grown
terrifying, and fled away up the trail through the
merciless, unconcealing moonlight, till he reached
the end of the open shelf and a black wood hid his
sudden fear of the unknown.</p>

<h2>Sonny and the Kid</h2>
</div>
<div class="drop">
<img src="images/T.png" title="" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class='cap_11'><span class="dcap">THE</span> little old gray house, with its gray
barn and low wagon shed, stood in the
full sun at the top of a gullied and stony
lane. Behind it the ancient forest, spruce and fir
and hemlock, came down and brooded darkly over
the edge of the rough, stump-strewn pasture. The
lane, leading up to the house from the main road,
climbed between a sloping buckwheat field on the
one hand and a buttercupped meadow on the other.
On either side of the lane, cutting it off from the
fields, straggled a zigzag snake fence, with milk-weed,
tansy, and mullein growing raggedly in its
corners.</p>
</div>
<p>At the head of the lane, where it came out upon
the untidy but homely looking yard, stood a largish
black and tan dog, his head on one side, his ears
cocked, his short stub of a tail sticking out straight
and motionless, tense with expectation. He was
staring at a wagon which came slowly along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
main road, drawn by a jogging, white-faced sorrel.
The expression in the dog&rsquo;s eyes was that of a hope
so eager that nothing but absolute certainty could
permit him to believe in its approaching fulfilment.
His mouth was half open, as if struggling to aid
his vision.</p>
<p>He was an odd looking beast, formidable in his
sturdy strength and his massiveness of jaw; and
ugly beyond question, but for the alert intelligence
of his eyes. A palpable mongrel, he showed none
the less that he had strains of distinction in his ancestry.
English bull was the blood most clearly
proclaimed, in his great chest, short, crooked legs,
fine coat, and square, powerful head. His pronounced
black and tan seemed to betray some
beagle kinship, as did his long, close-haired ears.
Whoever had docked his tail, in his defenceless
puppyhood, had evidently been too tender-hearted
to cut those silken and sensitive ears. So Sonny
had been obliged to face life in the incongruous
garb of short tail and long ears&ndash;&ndash;which is almost
as unpardonable as yellow shoes with a top hat.</p>
<p>When the wagon drew close to the foot of the
lane, Sonny was still uncertain. There might be
other white faced sorrels than lazy old Bill. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
man in the wagon certainly looked like his beloved
master, Joe Barnes; but Joe Barnes was always
alone on the wagon-seat, while this man had a child
beside him, a child with long, bright, yellow hair
and a little red cap. This to Sonny was a bewildering
phenomenon. But when at last the wagon
turned up the lane, his doubts were finally resolved.
His stub of a tail jerked spasmodically, in its struggle
to wag. Then with two or three delirious yelps
of joy he started madly down the lane. At the
sound of his voice the door of the gray house
opened. A tall, thin woman in a bluish homespun
skirt and red calico waist came out, and moved
slowly across the yard to welcome the new arrivals.</p>
<p>When Sonny, yelping and dancing, met the
creaking wagon as it bumped its way upward over
the gullies, his master greeted him with a &ldquo;Hello,
Sonny!&rdquo; as usual; but to the dog&rsquo;s quick perception
there was a difference in his tone, a difference
that was almost an indifference. Joe Barnes was
absorbed. At other times, he was wont to seem
warmly interested in Sonny&rsquo;s welcoming antics,
and would keep up a running fire of talk with him
while the old sorrel plodded up the lane. To-day,
however, Joe&rsquo;s attention was occupied by the yellow-haired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
child beside him; and Sonny&rsquo;s demonstrations,
he knew not why, became perceptibly less
ecstatic. It was of no consequence whatever to
him that the child stared at him with dancing eyes
and cried delightedly, &ldquo;Oh, Unc&rsquo; Joe, what a
pretty doggie! Oh, what a nice doggie! Can I
have him, Unc&rsquo; Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Kid,&rdquo; said Joe Barnes, gazing down
adoringly upon the little red cap; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s yourn.
His name&rsquo;s Sonny, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s the best dawg ever
chased a chipmunk. He&rsquo;ll love ye, Kid, most as
much as yer old Unc&rsquo; Joe an&rsquo; Aunt Ann does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the yard was reached, the tall woman in
the red calico waist was at the side of the wagon
before the driver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; brought the horse
to a stop. The little one was snatched down from
the seat and hugged vehemently to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lamb! Precious lamb!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a mother to you, please God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my mummie! Where&rsquo;s she gone to?&rdquo;
cried the child, suddenly reminded of a loss which
he was beginning to forget. But his aunt changed
the subject hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he the livin&rsquo; image of Jim?&rdquo; she demanded
in a voice of wondering admiration. &ldquo;Did
ever you see the likes of it, father?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>Under the pretence of examining him more critically,
Joe took the child into his own arms, and
looked at him with ardent eyes. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the Kid does favour Jim, more&rsquo;n his&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But
he checked himself at the word. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a regular
little man too!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Come all the
way up on the cars by himself, an&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t a mite o&rsquo;
trouble, the conductor said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Utterly engrossed in the little one, neither Joe
nor his wife gave a look or a thought to Sonny,
who was leaping upon them joyously. For years
he had been almost the one centre of attention for
the childless couple, who had treated him as a child,
caressing him, spoiling him, and teaching him to
feel his devotion necessary to them. Now, finding
himself quite ignored, he quieted down all at once
and stood for a few seconds gazing reproachfully
at the scene. The intimacy with Joe and Ann
which he had so long enjoyed had developed almost
a human quality in his intelligence and his feelings.
Plainly, now, he was forgotten. His master and
mistress had withdrawn their love and were pouring
it out upon this stranger child. His ears and
stub tail drooping in misery, he turned away,
walked sorrowfully over to the horse, and sniffed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
at the latter&rsquo;s nose as if to beg for some explanation
of what had happened. But the old sorrel, pleasantly
occupied in cropping at the short, sweet grass
behind the well, had neither explanation nor sympathy
to offer. Sonny went off to his kennel, a
place he scorned to notice, as a rule, because the
best in the house had hitherto been held none too
good for him. Creeping in with a beaten air, he lay
down with his nose on his paws in the doorway,
and tried to understand what had come upon him.
One thing only was quite clear to him. It was all
the fault of the child with the yellow curls.</p>
<p>Sonny had had no experience with children. The
few he had met he had regarded with that impersonal
benevolence which was his attitude toward
all humanity. His formidable appearance had
saved him from finding out that humanity could be
cruel and brutal. So now, in his unhappiness, he
had no jealous anger. He simply wanted to keep
away from this small being who had caused his
hurt.</p>
<p>But even this grace was not to be allowed him.
By the time Joe Barnes and Ann, both trying to
hold the little one in their arms at the same time,
had made their impeded way to the house, the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
one had begun to find their ardour a shade embarrassing.
To him there were lots of things better
than being hugged and kissed. This shining green
backwoods world was quite new to his city born
eyes, and he wanted to find out all about it, at once,
for himself. He began struggling vigorously to
get down out of the imprisoning arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put me down, Unc&rsquo; Joe!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I
want to play with my doggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Kid,&rdquo; responded Joe, complying instantly.
&ldquo;Here Sonny, Sonny, come an&rsquo; git acquainted
with the Kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, come and see the Kid, Sonny!&rdquo; re&euml;choed
the woman, devouring the little yellow head with
her eyes. His real name was Alfred, but Joe had
called him &ldquo;the Kid,&rdquo; and that was to be his appellation
thenceforth.</p>
<p>Hearing his name called, Sonny emerged from
his kennel and came forward, but not with his
wonted eagerness. Very soberly, but with prompt
obedience he came, and thrust his massive head
under Joe&rsquo;s hand for the accustomed caress. But
the caress was not forthcoming. Joe simply forgot
it, so absorbed was he, his gaunt, weather-beaten
face glowing and melting with smiles as he gazed
at the child.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your dawg, Kid!&rdquo; said he, and watched
delightedly to see how the little one would go about
asserting proprietorship.</p>
<p>The woman was the more subtle of the two in
her sympathies. &ldquo;Sonny,&rdquo; she said, pulling the
dog forward, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the Kid, yer little master.
See you mind what he tells you, and see you take
good keer o&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny wagged his tail obediently, his load of
misery lightening under the touch of his mistress&rsquo;s
hand. He leaned against her knees, comforted for
a moment, though his love was more for the man
than for her. But he would not look at the Kid.
He shut his eyes with an expression of endurance
as the little one&rsquo;s hand patted him vehemently on the
face, and his stub tail stopped wagging. In a dim
way he recognized that he must not be uncivil to
this small stranger who had so instantaneously and
completely usurped his place. But beyond this he
could think of nothing but his master, who had
grown indifferent. Suddenly, with a burst of longing
for reconciliation, he jerked abruptly away from
the child&rsquo;s hands, wriggled in between Joe&rsquo;s legs,
and strove to climb up and lick his face.</p>
<p>At the look of disappointment which passed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the child&rsquo;s face Joe Barnes felt a sudden rush of
anger. Stupidly misunderstanding, he thought that
Sonny was merely trying to avoid the child. He
straightened up his tall figure, snatched the little
one to his breast, and exclaimed in a harsh voice,
&ldquo;If ye can&rsquo;t be nice to the Kid, git out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; with the tone in which
they were uttered, would have been comprehensible
to a much meaner intelligence than Sonny&rsquo;s. As
if he had been whipped, he curled down his abbreviated
tail, and ran and hid himself in his kennel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny didn&rsquo;t mean to be ugly to the Kid,
father,&rdquo; protested Ann, &ldquo;He jest don&rsquo;t quite understand
the situation yet, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s wonderin&rsquo; why
ye don&rsquo;t make so much of him as ye used to. I
don&rsquo;t blame him fer feelin&rsquo; a leetle mite left out
in the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe felt a vague suspicion that Ann might be
right; but it was a very vague suspicion, just
enough to make him feel uneasy and put him on
the defensive. Being obstinate and something of a
crank, this only added heat to his irritation. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t got no use fer any dawg that don&rsquo;t know
enough to take to a kid on sight!&rdquo; he declared,
readjusting the little red cap on the child&rsquo;s curls.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, father,&rdquo; acquiesced Ann discreetly;
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll find Sonny&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the child, who had been squirming with
impatience, piped up, &ldquo;I want to go an&rsquo; see my
doggie in his little house!&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Kid, we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to let Sonny be fer a
bit. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to see the calf, the pretty black
an&rsquo; white calf, round back o&rsquo; the barn, now. You
go along with Aunty Ann while I onhitch old Bill.
An&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll all go an&rsquo; see the little pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind altogether diverted by the suggestion
of such strange delights, the little fellow trotted
off joyously with Ann, while Joe Barnes led the old
sorrel to the barn, grumbling to himself at what
he chose to call Sonny&rsquo;s &ldquo;ugliness&rdquo; in not making
friends with the Kid.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>From that hour Sonny&rsquo;s life was changed. In
fact, it seemed to him no longer life at all. His
master&rsquo;s indifference grew swiftly to an unreasoning
anger against him; and as he fretted over it
continually, a malicious fate seemed to delight in
putting him, or leading him to put himself, ever in
the wrong. Absorbed in longing for his master, he
hardly thought of the child at all. Several times,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
in a blundering effort to make things right with
Sonny and the Kid, Joe seated himself on the back
doorstep, took the little one on his knee, and called
Sonny to come and make friends. At the sound
of the loved summons Sonny shot out from the
kennel, which had become his constant refuge, tore
wildly across the yard, and strove, in a sort of ecstasy,
to show his forgiveness and his joy by climbing
into Joe&rsquo;s lap. Being a large dog, and the lap
already filled, this meant roughly crowding out the
Kid, of whose very existence, at this moment,
Sonny was unaware. But to the obtuse man
Sonny&rsquo;s action seemed nothing more than a mean
and jealous effort to supplant the Kid.</p>
<p>To the Kid this proceeding of Sonny&rsquo;s was a fine
game. He would grapple with the dog, hug him,
pound him gleefully with his little fists, and call
him every pet name he knew.</p>
<p>But the man would rise to his feet angrily, and
cry, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all ye&rsquo;re good fer, git! Git out, I
tell ye!&rdquo; And Sonny, heartsore and bewildered,
would shrink back hopelessly to his kennel. When
this, or something much like it, had happened several
times, even Ann, for all her finer perceptions,
began to feel that Sonny might be a bit nicer to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Kid, and, as a consequence, to stint her kindness.
But to Sonny, sunk in his misery and pining only
for that love which his master had so inexplicably
withdrawn from him, it mattered little whether
Ann was neglectful or not.</p>
<p>Uneventfully day followed day on the lonely
backwoods farm. To Sonny, the discarded, the
discredited, they were all hopeless days, dark and
interminable. But to the Kid they were days of
wonder, every one. He loved the queer black and
white pigs, which he studied intently through the
cracks in the boarding of their pen. He loved the
calf, and the three velvet-eyed cows, and the two
big red oxen, inseparable yoke fellows. The
chickens were an inexhaustible interest to him; and
so were the airy throngs of buttercups afloat on
the grass, and the yet more a&euml;rial troops of the
butterflies flickering above them, white and brown
and red and black and gold and yellow and maroon.
But in the last choice he loved best of all the silent,
unresponsive Sonny, of whose indifference he
seemed quite unaware. Sonny, lying on the grass,
would look at him soberly, submit to his endearments
without one answering wag of the tail, and
at last, after the utmost patience that courtesy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
could require, would slowly get up, yawn, and
stroll off to his kennel or to some pretended business
behind the barn. His big heart harboured no
resentment against the child, whom he knew to be
a child and irresponsible. His resentment was all
against fate, or life, or whatever it was, the vague,
implacable force which was causing Joe Barnes to
hurt him. For Joe Barnes he had only sorrow and
hungry devotion.</p>
<p>Little by little, however, Sonny&rsquo;s lonely and sorrowful
heart, in spite of itself, was beginning to
warm toward the unconscious child. Though still
outwardly indifferent, he began to feel gratified
rather than bored when the Kid came up and gaily
disturbed his slumbers by pounding him on the
head with his little palm and tumbling over his
sturdy back. It was a mild gratification, however,
and seemed to call for no demonstrative expression.</p>
<p>Then, one noon, he chanced to be lying, heavy-hearted,
some ten or a dozen paces in front of the
kitchen door, while Joe Barnes sat on the doorstep
smoking his after-dinner pipe, and Ann bustled
through the dish washing. At such times, in the
old happy days, Sonny&rsquo;s place had always been at
Joe Barnes&rsquo;s feet; but those times seemed to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
been forgotten by Joe Barnes, who had the Kid
beside him. Suddenly, tired of sitting still, the
little one jumped up and ran over to Sonny. Sonny
resolutely pretended to be asleep. Laughingly the
child sprawled over him, pulled his ears gently,
then tried to push open his eyes. A little burst of
warmth gushed up in Sonny&rsquo;s sad heart. With a
swift impulse he lifted his muzzle and licked the
Kid, a generous, ample lick across the face.</p>
<p>Alas! as blundering fate would have it, the
Kid&rsquo;s face was closer than Sonny had imagined.
He not only licked it, but at the same time bumped
it violently with his wet muzzle. Taken by surprise
and half-dazed, the Kid drew back with a sharp
little &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; His eyes grew very wide, and for
an instant his mouth quivered as if he was going
to cry. This was all Joe Barnes saw. Springing
to his feet, with a smothered oath, he ran, caught
the Kid up in his arms, and gave Sonny a fierce
kick in the ribs which sent him rushing back to his
kennel with a howl of grief and pain.</p>
<p>Ann had come running from the house in amazement.
The Kid was sobbing, and struggling to get
down from Joe&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Ann snatched him away anxiously. &ldquo;What did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Sonny do to ye, the bad dawg!&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t bad. He&rsquo;s good. He jest kissed me
too hard!&rdquo; protested the little one indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hurt the Kid&rsquo;s face. I ain&rsquo;t right sure but
what he snapped at him,&rdquo; said Joe Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hurt me! He didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; went
on the Kid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ann with conviction.
&ldquo;Father, ye&rsquo;re too hard on the dawg. Ye hadn&rsquo;t
oughter have kicked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An obstinate look settled on Joe Barnes&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Yes, I had, too. &rsquo;N&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be gittin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n that,
ef he don&rsquo;t l&rsquo;arn not to be ugly to the Kid,&rdquo; he retorted
harshly. Then, with an uneasy sense that,
whether right or wrong, he was in the minority, he
returned to the doorstep and moodily resumed his
smoking. Ann called Sonny many times to come
out and get his dinner. But Sonny, broken-hearted,
and the ruins of all his life and love and trust tumbled
about his ears, would not hear her. He was
huddled in the back of his kennel, with his nose
jammed down into the corner.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Two days later it happened that both Joe and
Ann went down together into the field in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
the house to weed the carrot patch. They left the
Kid asleep in his trundle bed, in the little room off
the kitchen. When they were gone, Sonny came
out of his kennel and lay down in the middle of the
yard, where he could keep a watchful eye on everything
belonging to Joe Barnes.</p>
<p>It was the Kid&rsquo;s invariable custom to sleep
soundly for a good two hours of the early afternoon.
On this afternoon, however, he broke his
custom. Joe and Ann had not been ten minutes
away, when he appeared in the kitchen door, his
yellow hair tousled, his cheeks rosy, his plump fists
trying to rub the sleep out of his eyes. His face
was aggrieved, because he had woke up and found
himself alone. But at the sight of Sonny the grievance
was forgotten. He ran to the dog and began
to maul him joyously.</p>
<p>His recent bitter experience raw in his heart,
Sonny did not dare to respond, but lay with his
nose on his paws, unstirring, while the child
sprawled over him. After a few minutes this utter
unresponsiveness chilled even the Kid&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
He jumped up and cast his eyes about in search of
some diversion more exciting. His glance wandered
out past the barn and up the pasture toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
the edge of the forest. A squirrel, sitting on a
black stump in the pasture, suddenly began jumping
about and shrilly chattering. This was something
quite new and very interesting. The Kid
crawled through the bars and started up the pasture
as fast as his sturdy little legs could carry him.</p>
<p>The squirrel saw him coming, but knowing very
well that he was not dangerous, held his ground,
bouncing up and down on the stump in vociferous
excitement. When the Kid was within three feet
of him, he gave a wild &ldquo;K-r-r-r-r!&rdquo; of derision,
and sprang to another stump. With eyes dancing
and eager little hands outstretched, the Kid followed&ndash;&ndash;again
and again, and yet again&ndash;&ndash;till he
was led to the very edge of the wood. Then the
mocking imp in red fur whisked up an ancient hemlock,
and hid himself, in silence, in a high crotch,
tired of the game.</p>
<p>At the edge of the woods the Kid stopped, peering
in among the shadows with mingled curiosity
and awe. The bright patches of sunlight on the
brown forest floor and on the scattered underbrush
allured him. Presently, standing out in conspicuous
isolation, a great crimson toadstool caught his
eye. He wanted the beautiful thing intensely, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
play with. But he was afraid. Leaning his face
against the old fence, he gazed through desirously.
But the silence made him more and more afraid.
If only the squirrel would come back and play with
him, he would not be afraid. He was on the point
of giving up the beautiful crimson toadstool and
turning back home, when he saw a little gray bird
hopping amid the lower limbs of a spruce in among
the shadows. &ldquo;Tsic-a-dee-dee!&rdquo; whistled the little
gray bird, blithely and reassuringly. At once the
shadows and the stillness lost their terrors. The
Kid squeezed boldly through the fence and started
in for the glowing toadstool.</p>
<p>Just as he reached the coloured thing and stooped
to seize it, a sharp &ldquo;Tzip, tzip!&rdquo; and a rustling of
stiff feathers startled him. Looking up, he saw a
bright-eyed brown bird running hither and thither
before him, trailing one wing on the ground as if
unable to fly. It was such a pretty bird! And it
seemed so tame! The Kid felt sure he could catch
it. Grabbing up the crimson toadstool, and holding
it clutched to his bosom with one hand, he ran eagerly
after the brown bird. The bird, a wily old
hen partridge, bent on leading the intruder away
from her hidden brood, kept fluttering laboriously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
on just beyond his reach, till she came to a dense
patch of underbrush. She was just about to dive
into this thicket, when she leaped into the air, instead,
with a frightened squawk, and whirred up
into the branches of a lofty birch near by.</p>
<p>Bitterly disappointed, the Kid gazed up after
her, still clutching the bright toadstool to his breast.
Then, by instinct rather than by reason, he dropped
his eyes to the thicket, and stared in to see what
had frightened away the pretty brown bird.</p>
<p>At first he could see nothing. But to his sensitive
little nerves came a feeling that something
was there. Gradually his eyes, accustoming themselves
to the gloom, began to disentangle substance
and shadow. Then suddenly he detected the form
of a gray crouching animal. He saw its tufted
ears, its big round face, with mouth half open grinningly.
Its great, round, pale, yellow green eyes
were staring straight at him.</p>
<p>In his fright the Kid dropped his toadstool and
stared back at the gray animal. His first impulse
was to turn and run; but, somehow, he was afraid
to do that&ndash;&ndash;afraid to turn his back on the pale-eyed,
crouching shape. As he gazed, trembling,
he saw that the animal looked like a huge gray cat.</p>

&ldquo;IN HIS FRIGHT THE KID DROPPED HIS TOADSTOOL AND STARED BACK AT THE GRAY ANIMAL.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>At this thought he felt a trifle reassured. Cats
were kind, and nice to play with. A big cat
wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him, he felt quite sure of that. But
when, after a minute or two of moveless glaring,
the big cat, never taking its round eyes from his
face, began to creep straight toward him, stealthily,
without a sound, then his terror all came back. In
the extremity of his fear he burst out crying, not
very loud, but softly and pitifully, as if he hardly
knew what he was doing. His little hands hanging
straight down at his sides, his head bent slightly
forward, he stood helplessly staring at this strange,
terrible cat creeping toward him through the thicket.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Sonny, meanwhile, had grown uneasy the moment
the Kid climbed through the bars into the
pasture. The Kid had never gone into the pasture
before. Sonny got up, turned round, and lay down
in such a position that he could see just what the
child was doing. He knew the little one belonged
to Joe Barnes; and he could not let anything belonging
to Joe Barnes get lost or run away. When
the Kid reached the edge of the woods and stood
looking through the fence, then Sonny roused himself,
and started up the pasture in a leisurely, indifferent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
way, as if it was purely his own whim that
took him in that direction. He pretended not to
see the Kid at all. But in reality he was watching,
with an anxious intentness, every move the little
one made. He was determined to do his duty by
Joe Barnes.</p>
<p>But when at last the Kid wriggled through the
fence and darted into the gloom of the forest,
Sonny&rsquo;s solicitude became more personal. He
knew that the forest was a place of many strange
perils. It was no place for the Kid. A sudden
fear seized him at thought of what might happen
to the Kid, there in the great and silent shadows.
He broke into a frantic run, scrambled through the
fence, picked up the little adventurer&rsquo;s trail, and
darted onward till he caught sight of the Kid&rsquo;s
bright curly head, apparently intent on gazing into
a thicket. At the sight he stopped abruptly, then
sauntered forward with a careless air, as if it was
the most ordinary chance in the world that he
should come across the Kid, away off here alone.</p>
<p>Instinctively, under the subtle influence of the
forest silence, Sonny went forward softly, on his
toes, though anything like stealth was altogether
foreign to him. As he crept up, he wondered what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
it was in the thicket to keep him so still. There
was something mysterious about it. The hair began
to rise along Sonny&rsquo;s back. Then, a moment
later, he heard the Kid crying. There was no mistaking
the note of terror in that hopeless, helpless
little sound. Sonny did not need to reason about
it; his heart understood all that was necessary.
Something was frightening the Kid. His white
teeth bared themselves, and he darted forward.</p>
<p>At this instant there came a crackling and swishing
in the thicket; and the Kid, as if released from
a spell, turned with a scream and started to flee.
He tripped on a root, however, and fell headlong
on his face, his yellow curls mixing with the brown
twigs and fir needles. Almost in the selfsame second
a big gray lynx burst from the green of the
underbrush and sprang upon the little, sprawling,
helpless form.</p>
<p>But not actually upon it. Those outstretching,
murderous claws never actually sank into the Kid&rsquo;s
flesh. For Sonny was there just as soon as the
lynx was. The wild beast changed its mind, and
attack, just in time to avoid being taken at a serious
disadvantage. The rush of Sonny&rsquo;s heavy body
bore it backward clear of the Kid. The latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
scrambled to his feet, stifled his sobs, and stared
open-mouthed at the sudden fury of battle which
confronted him.</p>
<p>Had Sonny not been endowed with intelligence
as well as valour, he would have fallen victim almost
at once to his adversary&rsquo;s terrific, raking hind
claws. But fortunately, during his pugnacious
puppyhood he had had several encounters with war-wise,
veteran cats. To him, the lynx was obviously
a huge and particularly savage cat. He knew the
deadly power of its hind claws, with all the strength
of those great hind quarters behind them. As he
grappled with the screeching lynx, silently, after
the fashion of his bull ancestors, he received a ripping
slash from one of its armed fore paws, but
succeeded in fixing his grip on the base of the
beast&rsquo;s neck, not far from the throat. Instantly
he drew himself backward with all his weight,
crouching flat, and dragging the enemy down with
him.</p>
<p>In this position, Sonny, backing and pulling with
all his strength, the spitting and screeching cat was
unable to bring its terrible hinder claws into play.
The claws of the beast&rsquo;s great fore paws, however,
were doing cruel work on Sonny&rsquo;s back and sides;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
while its long fangs, pointed like daggers, tore savagely
at the one point on his shoulder which they
could reach. This terrible punishment Sonny took
stoically, caring only to protect the tender under
part of his body and his eyes. His close grip on
the base of the animal&rsquo;s neck shielded his eyes, and,
according to the custom of his tenacious breed, he
never relaxed his hold for a moment, but kept chewing
in, chewing in, inexorably working his way to
a final, fatal grip upon the throat. And not for a
moment, either, did he desist from his steady backward
pull, which kept the foe from doubling upon
him with its hind quarters.</p>
<p>For several minutes the furious struggle went
on, Sonny, apparently, getting all the worst of it.
His back and shoulders were pouring blood; while
his enemy showed not a hurt. Then suddenly the
gray beast&rsquo;s screeching took on a half strangling
sound. With its mouth wide open it ceased to bite,
though its fore paws raked and clawed more desperately
than ever. Sonny&rsquo;s relentless hold was
beginning to throttle. His mouth was now too full
of long fur and loose skin for him to bite clean
through the throat and finish the fight. But he felt
himself already the victor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>Suddenly, as he continued that steady backward
drag, the resistance ceased. The lynx had launched
itself forward in one last convulsive struggle to
free itself from those strangling teeth at its throat.
For a second or two Sonny felt himself overwhelmed,
engulfed, in a vortex of rending claws.
In a tight ball of hate and ferocity and horror the
two rolled over and over in the underbrush. Sonny,
doubled up hard to protect his belly, heard a shrill
cry of fear from the Kid. At the sound he summoned
into his strained nerves and muscles a
strength beyond the utmost which he had yet been
able to put forth. His jaws worked upward, secured
a cleaner grip, ground slowly closer; and at
last his teeth crunched together. A great shudder
shook the body of the lynx. It straightened out,
limp and harmless.</p>
<p>For perhaps a minute Sonny maintained his triumphant
grip, shaking the foe savagely. Satisfied,
at last, that he was meeting with no more resistance,
he let go, stood off, and eyed the body with searching
suspicion. Then he turned to the Kid. The
Kid, careless of the blood and wounds, kissed him
fervently on the nose, called him &ldquo;Poor Sonny!
Dear, good Sonny!&rdquo; and burst into a loud wailing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>Knowing that the one thing now was to get the
Kid home again as soon as possible, Sonny started,
looking back, and uttering a little imperative bark.
The Kid understood, and followed promptly. By
the time they reached the fence, however, Sonny
was so weak from loss of blood he could hardly
climb through. The Kid, with blundering but loving
efforts, helped him. Then he lay down.</p>
<p>At this moment the voices of Joe and Ann were
heard, shouting, calling wildly, from the yard. At
the sound, Sonny struggled to his feet and staggered
on, the Kid keeping close beside him. But
he could manage only a few steps. Then he sank
down again.</p>
<p>The man and woman came running up the pasture,
calling the Kid; but the latter would not leave
Sonny. He trotted forward a few steps, and
stopped, shaking his head and looking back. When
Joe and Ann came near enough to see that the little
one&rsquo;s face and hair and clothes were splotched with
blood, fear clutched at their hearts. &ldquo;My God!
what&rsquo;s happened to him?&rdquo; gasped Ann, striving
to keep up with her husband&rsquo;s pace. But Joe was
too quick for her. Darting ahead, he seized the
little one, lifted him up, and searched his face with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
frantic eyes. For all the blood, the child seemed
well and vigorous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it mean, Kid? Ye ain&rsquo;t hurt&ndash;&ndash;ye
ain&rsquo;t hurt&ndash;&ndash;tell me ye ain&rsquo;t hurt, Kid! What&rsquo;s
all this blood all over ye?&rdquo; he demanded breathlessly.</p>
<p>By this time Ann was at his side, questioning
with terrified eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t me, Unc&rsquo; Joe!&rdquo; protested the Kid. &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t hurted. It&rsquo;s poor Sonny. He&rsquo;s hurted awful.
He killed the great, big&ndash;&ndash;great, big&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the Kid
was at a loss how to explain, &ldquo;the great, big, dreadful
cat, what was goin&rsquo; to eat me up, Sonny did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Barnes looked at the dog, the torn sides,
streaming red wounds, and bloody muzzle. Woodsman
that he was, he understood. &ldquo;Sonny!&rdquo; he
cried in a piercing voice. The dog raised his head,
wagged his stump of a tail feebly, and made a
futile effort to rise.</p>
<p>Gulping down something in his throat, Joe
Barnes handed the child over to Ann, and strode
to Sonny&rsquo;s side. Bending over him, he tenderly
gathered the big dog into his arms, holding him
like a baby. Sonny reached up and licked his chin.
Joe turned and hastened back to the old gray house
with his burden.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, mother,&rdquo; he said, his voice a little
unsteady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to look out for the Kid
all by yerself for a bit now. I reckon I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to hev&rsquo; about all I kin do, a-nursin&rsquo; Sonny.&rdquo;</p>
